and to pay a fine of rs 10000 with default stipulation by principal district judge madurai.\\nhe was also convicted for offences punishable under section 392 read with section 397 ipc and sentence to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to pay a fine.\\nbackground facts in a nutshell are as follows.\\nthe deceased is one mayurani a sri lankan student who was residing in the first floor of the house belonging to one solsimalai p w 1 the accused is also a sri lankan student studying in a different college but staying in the second floor of the same premises.\\nthe occurrence allegedly took place in the afternoon of 22 4 2003.\\nthe first information report was lodged by p w 1 on 24 4 2003 at about 9 30 a m it was indicated in the first information report that on 24 4 2003 at 9 00 a m while the informant had gone to perform pooja in the first floor of the house he got foul smell in the last room of the first floor and found blood seeping through the front door.\\non opening the window he noticed that mayurani was lying in a pool of blood with her face covered with a bag.\\non the basis of the aforesaid f i r investigation was taken up initially by p w 40.\\nsubsequently on the basis of the order of the high court such investigation was completed by p w 42 the accused is stated to have been arrested on suspicion on 26 4 2003 on the basis of the statement of the accused

material were recovered allegedly on the basis of statement of the accused as well as p w 4who was working as a cleaner in the vehicle of p w 1 subsequently however p w 42who took over investigation from p w 40 filed charge sheet only against the present appellant on the footing that p ws 1 to 4 had no role to play in the crime.\\nthe prosecution relied upon only circumstantial evidence namely confessional statements of the accused leading to recovery of various incriminating materials.\\np 6 is the statement leading to recovery of travel bags m os 2 3knife m 0 5wooden log m 0 28rubber

prosecution has also relied upon the alleged motive to the effect that the accused urgently wanted money with a view to increase his marks in mathematics and therefore the accused had stolen articles belonging to the deceased.\\nthe trial court found the respondent guilty and recorded conviction and imposed sentence as aforestated.\\nthe trial court found that the prosecution version rested on circumstantial evidence.\\nthe following circumstances were highlighted to find the accused guilty.\\na the death is homicidal b the accused was in need of money to chase mathematics paper and for the aforesaid purpose he has killed the deceased to take away the valuable articles like computer and gold ornaments to sell such articles in the market.\\nc at the time of occurrence only the accused

other valuable articles such as computer gold ornamentsm dollar and the key chain with key belonging to the deceased.\\nthe high court found that the circumstances highlighted were not sufficient to fasten the guilt on the accused and directed acquittal.\\nlearned counsel for the appellant submitted that the high court failed to notice that the circumstances highlighted clearly establish the chain of circumstances which established the prosecution version and the high court was not justified in directing acquittal.\\nlearned counsel for the respondent on the other hand supported the judgment of the high court.\\nthe conviction based on circumstantial evidence has been highlighted by this court in various orders of this court.\\nit has been consistently laid down by this court that where a case rests squarely on circumstantial evidence the inference of guilt can be justified only when all the incriminating facts and circumstances are found to be incompatible with the

188it was laid down that where the case depends upon the conclusion drawn from circumstances the cumulative effect of the circumstances must be such as to negative the innocence of the accused and

3059wherein.\\nit has been observed thus.\\nin a case based on circumstantial evidence the settled law is that the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is drawn should be fully proved and such circumstances must be conclusive in nature.\\nmoreover all the circumstances should be complete and there should be no gap left in the chain of evidence.\\nfurther the proved circumstances must be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and totally inconsistent with his innocence.\\nin padala veera reddy v state of a p and ors air 1990.\\nsc 79 1989 indlaw sc 31it was laid down that when a case rests upon circumstantial evidence such evidence must satisfy the following tests 1 the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn must be cogently and firmly established 2 those circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused 3 the circumstances taken cumulatively should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and none else and 4 the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must be complete and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence.\\nin state of u p v.\\nashok kumar srivastava1992 crl.\\nlj 1104.\\n1992 indlaw sc 107it was pointed out that great care must be taken in evaluating circumstantial evidence and if the evidence relied on is reasonably capable of two inferences the one in favour of the accused must be accepted.\\nit was also pointed out that the circumstances relied upon must be found to have been fully established and the cumulative effect of all the facts so established must be consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt.\\nsir alfred wills in his admirable book wills circumstantial evidence chapter vi lays down the following rules specially to be observed in the case of circumstantial evidence 1 the facts alleged as the basis of any legal inference must be clearly proved and beyond reasonable doubt connected with the factum probandum 2 the burden of proof is always on the party who asserts the existence of any fact which infers legal accountability 3 in all cases whether of direct or circumstantial evidence the best evidence must be adduced which the nature of the case admits 4 in order to justify the inference of guilt the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt 5 if there be any reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused he is entitled as of right to be acquitted.\\nthere is no doubt that conviction can be based solely on circumstantial evidence but it should be tested by the touch stone of law relating to circumstantial evidence laid down by the this court as far back as in 1952.\\nin hanumant govind nargundkar and anr.\\nv state of madhya.\\npradeshair 1952 sc 343 1952 indlaw sc 89wherein it was observed thus it is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be in the first instance be fully established and all the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.\\nagain the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved.\\nin other words there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.\\na reference may be made to a later decision in sharad birdhichand sarda v state of maharashtraair 1984 sc 1622 1984 indlaw sc 432 therein while dealing with circumstantial evidence it has been held that onus was on the prosecution to prove that the chain is complete and the infirmity of lacuna in prosecution can not be cured by false defence or plea.\\nthe conditions precedent in the words of this court before conviction could be based on circumstantial evidence must be fully established.\\nthey are 1 the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established.\\nthe circumstances concerned must or should and not may be established 2 the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused that is to say they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty 3 the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency 4 they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved and 5 there must be a chain of evidence so compete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.\\nthese aspects were highlighted in state of rajasthan v rajaram 20038 scc 180 2003 indlaw sc 630state of haryana v jagbir singh anr 200311 scc 261 2003 indlaw sc 807.\\nthe main circumstances relied upon by the prosecution relates to the statements of the accused leading to discovery of materials facts admissible under section 27 of the indian evidence act1872 in short the evidence act.\\nlaw is well settled that the prosecution while relying upon the confessional statement leading to discovery of articles under section 27 of the evidence act has to prove through cogent evidence that the statement has been made voluntarily and leads to discovery of the relevant facts.\\nthe scope and ambit of section 27 of the evidence act had been stated and restated in several decisions of this court.\\nhowever in almost all such decisions reference is made to the observation of the privy council in pulukuri kotayya v emperor air 1947 pc 67 1946 indlaw pc 23 it is worthwhile to extract such quoted observation it is fallacious to treat the fact discovered within the section as equivalent to the object produced the fact discovered embraces the place from which the object is produced and the knowledge of the accused as to this and the information given must relate distinctly to this fact.\\ninformation as to past user or the past history of the object produced is not related to his discovery in the setting in which it is discovered.\\ninformation supplied by a person in custody that i will produce a knife concealed in the roof of my house does not lead to the discovery of the knife knives were discovered many years ago.\\nit leads to the discovery of the fact that a knife is concealed in the house of the informant to his knowledge and if the knife is proved to have been used in the commission of the offence the fact discovered is very relevant.\\nbut if to the statement the words be added with which stabbed athese words are inadmissible since they do not related to the discovery of the knife in the house of the informant.\\nat one time it was held that the expression fact discovered in the section is restricted to a physical or material fact which can be perceived by the senses and that it does not include a mental fact now it is fairly settled that the expression fact discovered includes not only the physical object produced but also the place from which it is produced and the knowledge of the accused as to this as noted in pulukuri kottaya 's case 1946 indlaw pc 23 supra.\\nthe various requirements of the section can be summed up as follows.\\nthe fact of which evidence is sought to be given must be relevant to the issue.\\nit must be borne in mind that the provision has nothing to do with the question of relevancy.\\nthe relevancy of the fact discovered must be established according to the prescriptions relating to relevancy of other evidence connecting it with the crime in order to make the fact discovered admissible.\\nthe fact must have been discovered.\\nthe discovery must have been in consequence of some information received from the accused and not by the accused 's own act.\\nthe person giving the information must be accused of any offence.\\nhe must be in the custody of a police officer.\\nthe discovery of a fact in consequence of information received from an accused in custody must be deposed to.\\n7 thereupon only that portion of the information which relates distinctly or strictly to the fact discovered can be proved.\\nthe rest is inadmissible.\\nas observed in pulukuri kottaya 's case 1946 indlaw pc 23 supra it can seldom happen that information leading to the discovery of a fact forms the foundation of the prosecution case.\\nit is one link in the chain of proof and the other links must be forged in a manner allowed by law.\\nto similar effect was the view expressed in k chinnaswamy reddy v state of a p air 1962 sc 1788 1962 indlaw sc 192.\\nthe above position was highlighted in anter singh v state of rajasthan air 2004 sc 2665 2004 indlaw sc 79.\\nin rammi alias rameshwar v state of madhya pradesh air 1999 sc 3544 1999 indlaw sc 1512 the scope and ambit of section 27 of the evidence act was analysed in great detail and it was concluded in para 12 as follows true such information is admissible in evidence under section 27 of the evidence act but admissibility alone would not render the evidence pertaining to the above information reliable.\\nwhile testing the reliability of such evidence the court has to see whether it was voluntarily stated by the accused.\\nsignificantly the prosecution has relied upon the evidence of pw 40 who was investigating initially.\\nhis evidence has to be considered in the background of what has been stated by pw 22 and cw 1 it has been accepted by the prosecution that great efforts were made by pw 40 to falsely implicate to pws 1 to 4 and for that purpose a departmental proceeding was initiated.\\neven according to the statement of the subsequent investigating officer pw 42several blank papers with the signature of pw 22 and cw 1 had been by pw 40 and such documents had been used to create false records to implicate pws 1 to 4 it is to be noted that pw 2 himself was one of the suspected person at the initial stage of investigation.\\nthat apart materials on record such as the statement of p w 22 recorded under section 164 of the code of criminal procedure1973.\\nin short the code and the statement of c w 1raise a reasonable doubt relating to voluntariness of the alleged confession.\\np w 22who is a close relation of the deceased cousin has stated that two days after the occurrence after the information that bala prasanna was roaming near lic colony anna nagar police brought him to the police station and bala prasanna was arrested at 5 00 p m and was taken to the police station and a witness was present there.\\nit is further stated that at the time of enquiry the accused was beaten up by the police and they have seized a gold ring and rs 5000 cash from him.\\nif this is the statement of p w 22 recorded under section 164 of the code a witness in whose presence the confessional statement leading to discovery of articles from the house of hajeeali p w 3 had been made it raises serious doubt regarding the voluntariness of the statement.\\nin this context it is also note worthy to indicate that c w 1 in his evidence has stated that the accused was in police station on 24 4 2003 itself.\\nsimilar statement is made by p w 4 that apart c w 1 has stated that no statement has been made in his presence.\\nthe prosecution version to the effect that even some signatures on blank papers had been taken from p w 22 and c w 1 thus assumes great importance.\\nthe alleged statement made by the accused led to discovery of knife bloodstained clothes rope etc.\\nunfortunately for the prosecution there is no evidence to show that in fact the wearing apparels containing bloodstains belonged to the accused save and except the alleged confessional statement.\\nno witness has spoken that those clothes were worn by the accused at any time far less at or about the time of occurrence.\\nit is also to be kept in view that those articles were recovered from the house of p w 3 and at the initial stage of investigation p w 3 himself was one of the suspected person and he was arrested.\\ntherefore the statement of p w 3 and his mother that those articles were brought by the accused and left in the upstairs room is to be considered with a pinch of salt.\\nmoreover there is nothing to indicate that in fact the bloodstained clothes and rope had tallied with the blood grouping of the deceased.\\nthe knife did not contain any bloodstain.\\ntherefore the aspect relating to recovery of articles from the house of p w 3 and his mother can not be considered as a link to complete the chain of circumstantial evidence.\\nthe next recovery relates to recovery of computer and accessories.\\napart from the fact that there is niggling doubt about the so called confession in view of statement under section 164 of the code of p w 22 and the statement of c w 1a further doubt is raised regarding such aspect in view of evidence of c w 1 to the effect that he had seen such computer in the room of the deceased when they had gone to the room after the offence was reported.\\nthe fact that c w 1 is a close relation of the deceased adds weight to his evidence rather than taking it away.\\neven accepting that the computer had been given to p w 15 by the accused such circumstance by itself does not unerringly points towards the guilt of the accused either in respect of offence of murder or even robbery.\\nit is quite possible that such articles might have been borrowed by the accused from the deceased and not necessarily stolen by the accused from the deceased after killing her.\\nthe fact that p w 9 had not initially stated anything before p w 40 about the accused coming down with computer at 3 30 p m and stated so for the first time when she was re examined after 5 months can not be lost sight of.\\nas a matter of fact p w 9 who was examined on the very date when police started investigation did not inform the police that she had seen the accused coming down from upstairs or that the accused had threatened her.\\nher statement to the following i did not tell anyone that balaprasanna took away the computer and threatened me.\\ni did not tell this even to the inspector of police after going to the police station.\\ni do not tell this even to p w 1.\\nthe next recovery relates to the ingots.\\nfor the aforesaid aspect the evidence of p ws 1718 and 19 is relevant.\\nsince the golden jewellery had been molten and were recovered in the shape of ingots it would be very hazardous to come to the conclusion that in fact the golden jewellery belonged to the deceased.\\nif the accused had killed the deceased and stolen those golden jewellery there is no reason as to why he had also not taken ear rings from the deceased.\\nthe fact that ear rings were on the dead body is admitted by the prosecution.\\nthe prosecution has strongly relied upon the fact that m dollar belonging to the deceased and a chain with key of the room of the deceased were discovered from inside the toilet in the room which was previously occupied by the accused.\\nfor the aforesaid purpose they have relied upon the evidence of p w 42 and the seizure witness p w 24 the accused had allegedly made earlier confessional statement before p w 40 on 26 4 2003 leading to discovery of several articles.\\nthe subsequent statement spoken to by p w 42the subsequent investigating officer is alleged to have been made only in september2003after about five months.\\nso far as the first confession statement made before p w 40 is concerned admittedly the accused was under physical custody at that time whereas at the time of last confession stated to have been made before p w 42the accused was on bail and he had been summoned by p w 42 for further examination and therefore technically in custody.\\nif the accused had not made such a statement at such first instance when he had confessed about other articles it is not understood as to how after 5 months when he was on bail he would make such a statement.\\nsuch alleged confession made belatedly thus creates doubt regarding its authenticity or voluntariness.\\nin this context it is to be noted that c w 1 states that m dollar was taken from him by p w 42 for the purpose of facilitating investigation.\\nkeeping in view the fact that c w 1 is a close relation of the deceased and obviously interested in punishing the real culprit such a statement coming from c w 1 can not be slightly brushed aside.\\nthe fact that there had been a statement allegedly made by p w 1 leading to recovery of a parallel key from the dash board of the car of p w 1cannot be lost sight of.\\nit is of course true that the prosecution has tried to exonerate p w 1 by adducing evidence through p ws 36 and 39 to the effect that immediately after recovery of the dead body p w 40 had taken two such keys thus contradicting the alleged confession of p w 1 however the very suspicious role of p w 40who apparently was in possession of at least two keys of the same lock creates suspicion regarding recovery of another key after 5 months.\\nlaw is well settled that when the prosecution relies upon circumstantial evidence all the links in the chain of circumstances must be complete and should be proved through cogent evidence.\\nwhen the judgment of the high court is analysed in the background of what has been stated by this court as regards circumstantial evidence the inevitable conclusion is that the impugned judgment of the high court does not suffer from any infirmity to warrant interference.\\nthe appeal is dismissed.\\nappeal dismissed.\\n\",\n          \"the appellant is a trust which wanted to establish a self financing engineering college and submitted an application during 1994 95 to the university of kerala as well as to all india council for technical education hereinafter called the aicte.\\nthere was an inspection by a team of professors of the university and it recommended favourably when it stated that the facilities provided by the appellant would be sufficient for establish ing an engineering college.\\nthe aicte sent a communication on 30 4 1995 stating that on the basis of the observations made by the expert committee and the recommendations made by the central regional committee state level committee and central task force as per the provisions of the aicte regulation dated 30 1 1994the aicte was granting conditional approval for establishing an engineering and technical college.\\nthe abovesaid approval was subject to the fulfilment of specific conditions mentioned in annexure i and the general conditions mentioned in annexure ii to the said letter.\\nin the event of contravention of the conditions guidelines norms and regula tions of the aicte the aicte could withdraw the approval at any time.\\nunder the impression that the state govt was to grant permission the appellant requested the state government by letter dated 24 6 1995 for permission to start the college.\\nmeanwhile the mahatama gandhi university by their letter dated 31 5 1995 forwarded to the government a list of colleges and courses for affiliation during the academic year 1995 96 the appellant 's college was shown as one of the colleges among the affiliated colleges for the said period.\\nthe appellant sent a reminder to the government on 26 8 1995 for permission for starting the college for the academic year 1995 96 and ultimately the government refused permission by informing the appellant by a letter dated 16 8 1996 as follows.\\nin inviting your attention to the reference cited i am to inform you that government regret their inability to comply with your request.\\nthereafter the appellant filed writ petition o p no 4612 of 1996 for quashing the said order and for a direction to sanction and establish an engineering college.\\nthe learned single judge of the high court by his judgment dated 14 1 1997 allowed the writ petition quashed the above said order of the government dated 16 8 1996 and directed the mahatama gandhi university to consider the appellant 's application for permanent affiliation without reference to the above letter of the government and pass appropriate order within 8 weeks from the date of the receipt of a copy of the judgment.\\nthe direction to pass a fresh order of affiliation was issued in view of the fact that the university contended before the learned single judge that unless the government granted approval permanent affiliation could not be granted.\\nthe government was also directed to reconsider its decision.\\nagainst the said judgment of the learned single judge the commis sioner and secretary of the government higher education department filed writ appeal no 1024 of 1997 the division bench of the high court allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the government and dismissed the writ petition.\\nthe division bench however observed that the appellant was at liberty to make a fresh application to the government of kerala for according sanction for setting up the engineering college or to request the government to consider the earlier application for a future academic year.\\nit is against the abovesaid judgment of the division bench that this appeal has been preferred.\\nlearned senior counsel for the appellant.\\nsri t l vishwanatha.\\niyer contended that the division bench erred in reversing the well considered judgment of the learned single judge and according to him after the coming into force of the aicte act1987the statutes conferring power on the state or university to the extent they were inconsistent with the central act were void.\\nin so far as institutions imparting technical education were concerned the university or the state government had no independent role to play except to the extent provided in the above said enactment in the present case the aicte had made inspections and was satisfied that the necessary infrastructure was available and that the appellant would be able to conform to the required standards of the education.\\nthe aicte had consulted the state of kerala as well as the mahatama gandhi university.\\nthe university had granted conditional approval as stated earlier.\\ntherefore the aicte consti tuted a task force and obtained its opinion and thereafter granted its approval on 13 11 1995 subject to various conditions.\\naccording to the learned senior counsel it was indeed not necessary for the appellant to have applied to the state government for any further sanction to establish the college.\\nit might be that under the relevant statutes of the university the university was required to obtain the views of the state government but that did not amount to requiring any approval of the state government and indeed if any such statute required the approval of the state government it would be void in view of what was stated by this court in state of tamil nadu.\\nanother v adhiyaman educational research institute.\\nothersl995 4 scc 104 1995 indlaw sc 1631.\\nsri t l viswanatha iyer also contended that though the state government stated in its counter affidavit filed in the high court that the policy of the government was not to grant approval to self financing engineering colleges to be established such a policy could not come in the way of the appellant in view of what this court has stated in similar circumstances in thirumuruga kirupan variyar thavathiru sundara swamigal medical education charitable trust v state of tamil nadu others1996 3 scc 15 1996 indlaw sc 858.\\non the other hand learned additional solicitor general sri mukul rohtagi contended on behalf of the state of kerala that the policy of the state of kerala at the relevant time was not to grant approval for establish ment of more engineering colleges in the state.\\nthe government had clarified in the counter affidavit filed in the high court that the government was not in a position to take a decision to start new engineering colleges without properly assessing the necessity of more engineering graduates from the state and without exploring the possibility of employment opportunities in the country as a whole.\\nalso there were four engineering colleges at kannur trichur kottayam and thiruvananthapuram districts and three private aided engineering colleges at palakkad ernakulam kothamangalam and kollam districts.\\nthe model engineering college emakulam was a selffinancing engineering college and others were the colleges at changannur and pathansamthitta and there was a self financing engineering college at kasargode.\\nthere were also two unaided engineering colleges at mallappuram and thiruvananthapuram.\\neven though the appellant trust was not seeking aid from the government and even assuming that it was financially self sufficient it would not be in the interests of the students employment to permit new engineering colleges to be established.\\nthus the government policy was not to grant fresh approvals.\\nif more approvals were granted it might lead to commercialisation of education.\\nthe following points arise for consideration 1.\\nwhether in view of the judgment of this court in state of tamil nadu another v adhiyaman educational research institute others1995 4 scc 104 1995 indlaw sc 1631the provisions of the aicte act1987 occupied the field and it was not necessary to obtain the further approval of the government or other authority.\\nwhether any statute in the state of kerala if it required such approval would be void.\\n2 whether the orders of rejection passed by the state government were valid on merits and whether the university should have granted further orders to continue the affiliation solely on the basis of the aicte permission.\\npoint 1.\\nthis point is more or less covered by the judgment of this court in state of tamil nadu.\\nbut in the context of s 10k regarding approval for starting a technical institution certain aspects of the judgment need to be highlighted.\\nbefore we refer to the abovesaid judgment it will be necessary to refer to certain provisions of the aicte act and the relevant regulations.\\nthe abovesaid act was an act to provide for the establishment of all india council for technical education with a view to the proper planning and coordinated development of the technical education system throughout the country the promotion of qualitative improvement of such education in relation to planned quantitative growth and the regulation and proper maintenance of norms and standards in the technical education system and for

earlier the above provisions of the aicte act came up for consideration in state of tamil nadu v adhiyaman educational research institute1995 4 scc 104 1995 indlaw sc 1631.\\nin the above matter the state of tamil nadu granted permission on 17 4 84 to all private managements to start private engineering colleges without financial commitment to government but subject to conditions.\\nat that time in 1984the aicte act was not on the statute book.\\nthe government of tamil nadu granted permission to the trust for the academic year 1987 88 to start an engineering college.\\nthe university also granted permission on 21 11 87 for the academic year 1987.\\n88 later on these permissions were withdrawn by the state after issuing show cause on 16 7 89 so did the university on 26 7 89 but by that date the aicte act1987 had come into force.\\nthe learned single judge and the division bench held in favour of the trust and quashed and orders of the government and the university.\\nthe said judgments were affirmed by this court.\\nit was held that the aicte act was referable to entry 66list.\\ni of the constitution of india relating to coordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions.\\nafter the constitutional amendment 42 amendment act1976 entry 25 of list iii in the concurrent list.\\nread education included technical education medical institution and universities subject to the provisions of entries 636465 and 66 of list i vocational and technical training of labour.\\nthus the state law under entry 23 of list iii would be repugnant to any law made by the parliament under entry 66 of list i to the extent of inconsistency.\\nthe tamil nadu act was of 1976 and the university act was of 1923 and were laws referable to the list.\\niii whether.\\nthey were preconstitutional or a post constitutional laws they would be repugnant to the aicte act passed by parliament under entry 66 of list.\\ni in the above case this court referred to the various provisions of the aicte act and on the question of repugnancy held as follows.\\nhence on the subjects covered by the statute the state could not make a law under entry 25 of list iii after the forty second amendment.\\nif there was any such existing law immediately before the commencement of the constitution within the meaning of art 372 of the constitution as the madras university act 1923 on the enactment of the present central act the provisions of the said law if repugnant to the provisions of the central act would stand impliedly repealed to the extent of repugnancy.\\nsuch repugnancy would have to be adjudged on the basis of the tests which are applied for adjudging repugnancy u art 254 of the constitution.\\nwe shall now refer to the above judgment dealing with the question of approval for establishing technical institutions under s 10k of the aicte act.\\nthe tamil nadu rules of 1976 made under the 1976 act had no doubt excluded technical institutions from the purview of the rules but this court pointed out that the rules were capable of being amended so as to extend to such technical institutions and that if they were so extended the state act of 1976 and the rules would require approval by the state government and that would be void.\\nit was stated that inasmuch as the state act will overlap and will be in conflict with the provisions of the central act in various areas.\\ngranting approval for starting new technical institution.\\ninspection of technical institution which are matters covered by the central act.\\nthis court then referred to the madras university act1923 it was held that s 10 of the central act dealt with various matters including granting approval for starting new technical institutionsand that so far as these matters were concerned.\\nit is not the university act and the university but it is the central act and the council created under it which will have the jurisdiction.\\nto that extent after the coming into force of the central act the provisions of the university act will be deemed to have become unenforceable.\\nthus in the two passages set out above this court clearly held that because of s 10k of the central act which vested the powers of granting approval in the council the t n act of 1976 and the university act1923 could not deal with any questions of approval for establishment of technical institutions.\\nall that was necessary was that under the regulations the aicte council had to consult them.\\nstatutory powers of the state of kerala and the m g university.\\nthe question is as to how far the judgment in the tamil nadu case is to be applied in the state of kerala.\\nlearned additional solicitor general stated before us that there was no statute in the state of kerala corresponding to the tamil nadu act of 1976 nor any other law which specifically required the approval of the state government.\\nit was however contended that the tamil nadu case was concerned only with the standards of education and as to who could fix them.\\nwe are not inclined to agree.\\nwe have already pointed out under point 1 that in the tamil nadu case s 10k of the aicte act was referred to and the power of approval for establishing a technical institution was considered in our opinion even if there was a state law in the state of kerala which required the approval of the state government for establishing technical institutions such a law would have been repugnant to the aicte act and void to that extent as held in the tamil nadu case.\\nthe only provision relied on before us by the state government which according to its learned senior counsel amounted to a statutory requirement of approval of the state government was the one contained in cl 97 of the kerala university first statute.\\nit reads as follows grant of affiliation 1.\\nafter considering the report of the commission and the report of the local inquiry if any and after making such further inquiry as it may deem necessary the syndicate shall decide after ascer taining the view of the government also whether the affiliation be granted or refused either in whole or part.\\nin case affiliation is granted the fact shall be reported to the senate at its next meet ing.\\nit will be noticed that cl 97 of the statute required that before the university took a decision on affiliationit had to ascertain the views of the state government.\\nthe reference to the commission in the above cl 97 is to the commission of inspection appointed by the university.\\nsub cl 1 of cl 9 of the statute required verification of the facilities that may exist for starting the new colleges course.\\nthe commission was to inspect the site verify the title deeds as regards the proprietary right of the management over the land and buildings if any offered building accommodation provided if any assets of the management constitution of the registered body and all other relevant matters sub cl 2 of cl 9 stated that the affiliation shall depend upon the fulfilment by the management of all the conditions for the satisfactory establishment and maintenance of the proposed institutional courses of studies and on the reports of inspection by the commission or commissions which the university may appoint for the purpose.\\nas held in the tamil nadu case the central act of 1987 and in particular s 10k occupied the field relating the grant of approvals for establishing technical institutions and the provisions of the central act alone were to be complied with.\\nso far as the provisions of the mahatma gandhi university act or its statutes were concerned and in particular statute 97they merely required the university to obtain the views of the state government.\\nthat could not be characterised as requiring the approval of the state government.\\nif indeed the university statute could be so inter preted such a provision requiring approval of the state government would be repugnant to the provisions of s 10k of the aicte act1987 and would again be void.\\nas pointed out in the tamil nadu case there were enough provisions in the central act for consultation by the council of the aicte with various agencies including the state governments and the universities concerned.\\nthe state level committee and the central regional committees contained various experts and state representatives.\\nin case of difference of opinion as between the various consultees the aicte would have to go by the views of the central task force.\\nthese were sufficient safeguards for ascertaining the views of the state governments and the universities.\\nno doubt the question of affiliation was a different matter and was not covered by the central act but in the tamil nadu case it was held that the university could not impose any conditions inconsistent with the aicte act or its regulation or the conditions imposed by the aicte therefore the procedure for obtaining the affiliation and any conditions which could be imposed by the university could not be inconsistent with the provisions of the central act.\\nthe university could not therefore in any event have sought for approval of the state government.\\nthus we hold in the present case that there was no statutory require ment for obtaining the approval of the state government and even if there was one it would have been repugnant to the aicte act.\\nthe university statute 97 merely required that the views of the state government be obtained before granting affiliation and this did not amount to obtaining approval.\\nif the university statute required approvalit would have been repugnant to the aicte act.\\npoint 1 is decided accordingly.\\npoint 2.\\nfactual position and pleadings in this case.\\non facts the position was that the aicte had granted approval on 30 4 95 expressly stating that this was on consideration of the observations made by the expert committee and the recommendations made by the central regional committee state level committee central task force as per the provisions of aicte regulations dated 31 10 94.\\nthe aicte had granted condition approval and the conditions were specified in annexure.\\ni to the order and the general conditions were enlisted in annexure ii the.\\nstate government was directed by the aicte to announce admission in accordance with regulation notified on 20 5 94 and based on the judgment of the supreme court in unnikrishnan v state of andhra pradesh1993 1 scc.\\n645 1993 indlaw sc 1168 the mahatma gandhi university had included this appellant in the list of colleges and courses which were granted affiliation during 1995 96 and the university had written to the state government on 31 5 95 that as per statute 97the views of the government were to be sent before granting affili ation.\\nthe letter said that for that reason the proposals of the university were being submitted to the government for necessary action.\\nthe appellant had sent a reminder on 26 8 95 the state in its letter dated 16 8 96 to the appellant merely stated that government regret their inability to comply with your request.\\nno reasons were assigned in the said letter.\\nbut the state in its counter filed in the high court tried to explain that the director of technical education had opined that during the year 1995 96it might not be practicable to start the college for the director could not ascertain the details of the facilities available.\\nit was stated he could not ascertain the infrastructural facilities provided by the appellant as per the norms prescribed by the all india council of technical education.\\nthe all india council for technical education and the mahatma gandhi university have sought for the remarks of the state government.\\npara 4 of the counter affidavit had further stated that the government was not in a position to take a decision to start new engineering college without properly assessing the necessity of more engineering gradu ates in the state and exploring the possibility of employment oppor tunity in the country to the extent possible.\\nthe state government in its counter then gave the names of the existing colleges and their location.\\nwe have already referred to these details.\\nit also observed that there was widespread student prospects against starting new colleges and it was necessary to be cautious in the matter of starting new engineering colleges.\\nit was stated that government could not initially take a decision on the appellant 's affiliation because of elections and that matter being one of major policy the government had subsequently taken a policy decision not to sanction any affiliation to such colleges either in the private sector or in the public sector for this year.\\nthese are stated to be the reasons for the government 's rejection by letter dated 16 8 96.\\nstate government 's refusal to grant permission is illegal and void on merits.\\nas already stated in view of the judgment of this court in tamil nadu case it is obvious that there is no need to approach the state of kerala for its approval for starting the engineering colleges.\\nthere is no power vested in the state under any state law to grant approval and even if it was so vested it would have been void in view of tamil nadu case.\\nthis ground of repugnancy alone would be sufficient to quash the state government 's letter dated 16 8 1996 refusing to give their approval.\\neven on merits the reasons given by the state government in its counter are not tenable in law.\\nthe director of technical education of the state was a member of the state level committee as per regulation 94 of the aicte regulations.\\nthe secretary technical education of the state of kerala was also a member of that committee.\\nthe aicte 's approval dated 30 4 95 showed that the approval had been given by the state level com mittee of which they were obviously members.\\nit is therefore not under standable how the director had given a contrary opinion to the state government.\\nregulation 84 of aicte only required calling for the com ments recommendations of the state government and of the university.\\nin case there was difference between the state government university or the regional committee the central task force was to make a final recommen dation under regulation.\\n84 here.\\nthe letter of approval of the aicte dated 30 4 95 showed that the central task force had given its approval.\\nthe said approval was based also on the inspection by the expert committee of the aicte hence the state government in its counter could not have relied upon any contrary opinion of the director of technical education.\\nif the state government had any other valid objections its only remedy was to place its objections before the aicte council under the aicte act or before the committees e g state level committee etc.\\nthe so called policy of the state as mentioned in the counter affidavit filed in the high court was not a ground for refusing approval.\\nin thirwnuruga kirupan and variyar thavathiru sundara swamigal medical education charitable trust v state of tamil nadu others1996 3 scc 15 1996 indlaw sc 858which was a case relating to medical education and which also related to the effect of a central law upon a law made by the state under entry 25 list iii it was held that the essentiality certificate can not be withheld by the state government on any policy consideration because the policy in the matter of establishment of a new medical college now vests with the central government alone.\\ntherefore the state could not have any policy outside the aicte act and indeed if it had a policy it should have placed the same before the aicte and that too before the latter granted permission.\\nonce that procedure laid down in the aicte act and regulations had been followed under regulation 84and the central task force had also given its favourable recommendations there was no scope for any further objection or approval by the state.\\nwe may however add that if thereafter any fresh facts came to light after an approval was granted by the aicte or if the state felt that some conditions attached to the permission and required by the aicte to be complied with were not complied with then the state government could always write to the aicte to enable the latter to take appropriate action.\\ndecision of university in not granting further or fined affiliation wrong on merits.\\nadmittedly the university 's inspection report was in favour of the appellant.\\nthis is clear from the appellant 's letter dated 31 5 95 to the state government.\\nthe only requirement as per the statute 97 was for the university to obtain the views of the state government.\\nobtaining the views of the state government as already stated did not amount to obtaining its approval.\\nprocedure and conditions for affiliation could not be inconsistent with the provisions of the central act in particular s 10k of the regulation and the university could not seek approval of government.\\nthe university was also one of the agencies consulted by the council of the aicte under regulation 8 once that was over and approval was granted by the aicte if there was any default on the part of the college in compliance with the conditions of approval the only remedy for the univer sity was to bring those facts to the notice of the aicte so that the latter could take appropriate action.\\nreliance for the respondent was placed upon the subsequent report of the syndicate dated 7 8 97 this report no doubt pointed out that the appellant had not complied with certain conditions mentioned in the approval dated 30 4 95 granted by the aicte assuming certain fresh facts had come to the notice of the university it could only place the said facts before the aicte.\\nthus the university ought to have considered the grant of final or further affiliation without waiting for any approval from the state govern ment and should have acted on the basis of the permission granted by aicte and other relevant factors in the university act or statutes which are not inconsistent with the aicte act or its regulations.\\nfor the aforesaid reasons we set aside the judgment of the division bench of the high court and uphold the reasoning of the learned single judge in his judgment in op 461296 dated 14 1 1997 we hold that the approval of the aicte was sufficient we do not also think that it was necessary for the learned single judge to direct the state government to reconsider its decision.\\nthe learned single judge 's order quashing the letter of the state government dated 16 8 96 is upheld.\\nthe direction to the mahatama gandhi university to consider the application of the appellant for final affiliation or continuance of affiliation is confirmed and this is to be done on the basis of the approval granted by the aicte dated 30 4 95or any other relevant factors in the university act or its statutes which are not inconsistent with the aicte act or its regulations.\\nthe appeal is allowed and disposed of as stated above.\\nthere will be no order as to costs.\\nm jagannadha rao j.\\nthe petitioner was not a party in the high court of kerala and this special leave petition was filed with leave of this court.\\nwe find that the petitioner has already filed a writ petition in the delhi high court namely cwp no 952 of 1998 and the same is pending.\\nit will be for the petitioner to have the said matter disposed of by the high court of delhi.\\ntherefore this special leave petition is dismissed as premature.\\nappeal allowed.\\n\",\n          \"it was just the other day that our brothers

alleged exploitation by big manufacturers of bulk drugs.\\nthe problem is that of high prices bearing it is said little relation to the cost of production to the manufacturers.\\nby way of

the central government.\\nthe price which the manufacturer of barlagan kotone reported to the central government in 1971 was rs 24735 68 per kg.\\nafter the 1979 drugs prices control.\\norder came into force the distinction between essential and non essential bulk drugs was abolished and a maximum price had to be fixed for barlagan ketone also like other bulk drugs.\\nthe manufacturer applied for fixation of price at rs 8500 per kg.\\nthe government however fixed the price at rs 1810 per kg.\\nfor the moment ignoring the price fixed by the government we see that the price of rs 24735 per kg.\\nat which the manufacturer was previously selling the drug and at which he continues to market the drug to this day because of the quashing of the order fixing the price by the high court is so unconsciously high even compared with the price claimed by himself that it appears to justify the charge that some manufacturers do indulge in profiteering.\\nprofiteering by itself is evil.\\nprofiteering in the scarce resources of the community much needed life sustaining food stuffs and lifesaving drugs is diabolic.\\nit is a menance which had to be lettered and curbed.\\none of the principal objectives of the essential commodities act 1955 is precisely that.\\nt must be remembered that article 39b enjoins a duty on the state towards securing that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good.\\nthe essential commodities act is a legislation towards that end.\\nsection 31 of the essential commodities act enables the central government if it is of opinion that it is necessary or expedient so to do for maintaining or increasing supplies of any essential commodity or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair price to provide for regulating or prohibiting by order the production supply and distribution thereof and trade and commerce therein.\\nin particular section 32c enables the central government to make an order providing for controlling the price at which any essential commodity may be bought or sold.\\nit is in pursuance of the powers granted to the central government by the essential commodities act that first the drugs prices control.\\norder 1970 and later the drugs prices control.\\norder 1979 were made.\\narmed with authority under the drugs prices control.\\norder 1979 the central government issued notifications fixing the maximum prices at which various indigenously manufactured bulk drugs may be sold by the manufacturers.\\nthese notifications were questioned on several grounds by the manufacturers and they have been quashed by the delhi high court on the ground of failure to observe the principles of natural justice.\\nsince prices of formulations are primarily dependent on prices of buli drugs the notifications fixing the retail prices of formulations were also quashed.\\nthe manufacturers had also filed review petitions before the government under paragraph 27 of the 1979 order.\\nthe review petitions could not survive after the notifications sought to be reviewed had themselves been quashed.\\nnevertheless the high court gave detailed directions regarding the manner of disposal of the review petitions by the high court.\\nthe union of india has preferred these appeals by special leave of this court against the judgment of the high court.\\nthe case for the union of india was presented to us ably by shri g ramaswami the learned additional solicitor general and the manufacturers were represented equally ably by shri anil diwan.\\nbefore we turn to the terms of the drugs prices control.\\norder 1979 we would like to make certain general observations and explain the legal position in regard to them.\\nwe start with the observation price fixation is neither the function nor the forte of the court.\\nwe concern ourselves neither with the policy nor with the rates.\\nbut we do not totally deny ourselves the jurisdiction to enquire into the question in appropriate proceedings whether relevant considerations have gone in and irrelevant considerations kept out of the determination of the price.\\nfor example if the legislature has decreed the pricing policy and prescribed the factors which should guide the determination of the price we will if necessary enquire into the question whether the policy and the factors are present to the mind of the authorities specifying the price.\\nbut our examination will stop there.\\nwe will go no further.\\nwe will not deluge ourselves with more facts and figures.\\nthe assembling of the raw materials and the mechanics of price fixation are the concern of the executive and we leave it to them.\\nand we will not revaluate the considerations even if the prices are demonstrably injurious to some manufacturers or producers.\\nthe court will of course examine if there is any hostile discrimination.\\nthat is a different cup of tea altogether.\\nthe second observation we wish to make is legislative action plenary or subordinate is not subject to rules of natural justice.\\nin the case of parliamentary legislation the proposition is self evident.\\nin the case of subordinate legislation it may happen that parliament may itself provide for a notice and for a hearing there are several instances of the legislature requiring the subordinate legislating authority to give public notice and a public hearing before say for example levying a municipal rate  in which case the substantial non observance of the statutorily prescribed mode of observing natural justice may have the effect of invalidating the subordinate legislation.\\nthe right here given to rate payers or others is in the nature of a concession which is not to detract from the character of the activity as legislative and not quasijudicial.\\nbut where the legislature has not chosen to provide for any notice or hearing no one can insist upon it and it will not be permissible to read natural justice into such legislative activity.\\noccasionally the legislature directs the subordinate legislating body to make such enquiry as it thinks fit before making the subordinate legislation.\\nin such a situation while such enquiry by the subordinate legislating body as it deems fit is a condition precedent to the subordinate legislation the nature and the extent of the enquiry is in the discretion of the subordinate legislating body and the subordinate legislation is not open to question on the ground that the enquiry was not as full as it might have been.\\nthe provision for such enquiry as it thinks fit is generally an enabling provision intended to facilitate the subordinate legislating body to obtain relevant information from all and whatever source and not intended to vest any right in any one other than the subordinate legislating body.\\nit is the sort of enquiry which the legislature itself may cause to be made before legislating an enquiry which will not confer any right on anyone.\\nthe third observation we wish to make is price fixation is more in the nature of a legislative activity than any other.\\nit is true that with the proliferation of delegated legislation there is a tendency for the line between legislation and administration to vanish into an illusion.\\nadministrative quasi judicial decisions tend to merge in legislative activity and conversely legislative activity tends to fade into and present an appearance of an administrative or quasi judicial activity.\\nany attempt to draw a distinct line between legislative and administrative functions it has been said is difficult in theory and impossible in practice.\\nthough difficult it is necessary that the line must sometimes be drawn as different legal fights and consequences may ensue.\\nthe distinction between the two has usually been expressed as one between the general and the particular.\\na legislative act is the creation and promulgation of a general rule of conduct without reference to particular cases an administrative act is the making and issue of a specific direction or the application of a general rule to a particular case in accordance with the requirements of policy.\\nlegislation is the process of formulating a general rule of conduct without reference to particular cases and usually operating in future administration is the process of performing particular acts of issuing particular orders or of making decisions which apply general rules to particular cases.\\nit has also been said rule making is normally directed toward the formulation of requirements having a general application to all members of a broadly identifiable class while an adjudication on the other hand applies to specific individuals or situations.\\nbut this is only a bread distinction not necessarily always true.\\nadministration and administrative adjudication may also be of general application and there may be legislation of particular application only.\\nthat is not ruled out.\\nagain adjudication determines past and present facts and declares rights and liabilities while legislation indicates the future course of action.\\nadjudication is determinative of the past and the present while legislation is indicative of the future.\\nthe object of the rule the reach of its application the rights and obligations arising out of it its intended effect on past present and future events its form the manner of its promulgation are some factors which may help in drawing the line between legislative and non legislative acts.\\na price fixation measure does not concern itself with the interests of an individual manufacturer or producer.\\nit is generally in relation to a particular commodity or class of commodities or transactions.\\nit is a direction of a general character not directed against a particular situation.\\nit is intended to operate in the future.\\nit is conceived in the interests of the general consumer public.\\nthe right of the citizen to obtain essential articles at fair prices and the duty of the state to so provide them are transformed into the power of the state to fix prices and the obligation of the producer to charge n6 more than the price fixed.\\nviewed from whatever angle the angle of general application the prospectivity of its effect the public interest served and the rights and obligations flowing therefrom there can be no question that price fixation is ordinarily a legislative activity.\\npricefixation may occasionally assume an administrative or quasi judicial character when it relates to acquisition or requisition of goods or property from individuals and it becomes necessary to fix the price separately in relation to such individuals.\\nsuch situations may arise when the owner of property or goods is compelled to sell his property or goods to the government or its nominee and the price to be paid is directed by the legislature to be determined according to the statutory guidelines laid down by it.\\nin such situations the determination of price may acquire aquasi judicial character.\\notherwise price fixation is generally a legislative activity.\\nwe also wish to clear a misapprehension which appears to prevail in certain circles that price fixation affects the manufacturer or producer primarily and therefore fairness requires that he be given an opportunity and that fair opportunity to the manufacturer or producer must be read into the procedure for price fixation.\\nwe do not agree with the basic premise that price fixation primarily affects manufacturers and producers.\\nthose who are most vitally affected are the consumer public.\\nit is for their protection that price fixation is resorted to and any increase in price affects them as seriously as any decrease does a manufacturer if not more.\\nthe three observations made by us are well settled and wellfounded on authority.\\nthe cases to which we shall now refer will perhaps elucidate what we have tried unfelicitously to express.\\nin shree meenakshi mills ltd v union of india 1974.\\n1 scc 468 1973 indlaw sc 291 a notification fixing the

bench of the court observed that the dominant object and the purpose of the legislation was the equitable distribution and availability of commodities at fair price and if profit and the producer 's return were to be kept in the forefront it would result in losing sight of the object and the purpose of the legislation.\\nif the prices of yarn or cloth were fixed in such a way to enable the manufacturer or producer recover his cost of production and secure a reasonable margin of profit no aspect of infringement of any fundamental right could be said to arise.\\nit was to be remembered that the mere fact that some of those were engaged in the industry trade or commerce allegedthat they were incurring loss would not render the law stipulating the price unreasonable.\\nit was observed the control of prices may have effect either on maintaining or increasing supply of commodity or securing equitable distribution and availability at fair prices.\\nthe controlled price has to retain this equilibrium in the supply and demand of the commodity.\\nthe cost of production a reasonable return to the producer of the commodity are to be taken into account.\\nthe producer must have an incentive to produce.\\nthe fair price must be fair not only from the point of view of the consumer but also from the point of view of the producer.\\nin fixing the prices a price line has to be held in order to give preference or pre dominant consideration to the interest of the consumer or the general public over that of the producers in respect of essential commodities.\\nthe aspect of ensuring availability of the essential commodities to the consumer equitably and at fair price is the most important consideration.\\nthe producer should not be driven out of his producing business.\\nhe may have to bear loss in the same way as he does when he suffers losses on account of economic forces operating in the business.\\nif an essential commodity is in short supply or there is hoarding concerning or there is unusual demand there is abnormal increase in price.\\nif price increases it becomes injurious to the consumer.\\nthere is no justification that the producer should be given the benefit of price increase attributable to hoarding or cornering or artificial short supply.\\nin such a case if an escalation in price is contemplated at intervals the object of controlled price may be stultified.\\nthe controlled price will enable both the consumer and the producer to tide over difficulties.\\ntherefore any restriction in excess of what would be necessary in the interest of general public or to remedy the evil has to be very carefully considered so that the producer does not perish and the consumer is not crippled.\\nthe cases of panipat sugar mills and anakapalle co operative agricultural society were distinguished on the ground that they were governed by sub section 3c of sec.\\n3 of the essential commodities act and therefore had no relevance to the case before the constitution bench.\\nthe case of premier automobiles was distinguished on the ground that the decision was rendered by invitation and on the agreement of the parties irrespective of technical and legal questions.\\nthe court quoted with approval a passage from secretary of agriculture v central reig refining company 330 us 604 stating suffice it to say that since congress fixed the quotas on a historical basis it is not for this court to reweigh the relevant factors and per chance substitute its notion of expediency and fairness for that of congress.\\nthis is so even though the quota thus fixed may demonstrably be disadvantageous to certain areas or persons.\\nthis court is not a tribunal for relief from the crudities and inequities of complicated experimental economic legislation.\\nin saraswati industrial syndicate ltd v union of india 1974 2 scc 630 1974 indlaw sc 134 the court observed price fixation is more in the nature of a legislative measure even though it may be based upon objective criteria found in a report or other material.\\nit could not therefore give rise to a complaint that a rule of natural justice has not been followed in fixing the price.\\nnevertheless the criterion adopted must be reasonable.\\nreasonableness for purposes of judging whether there was an excess of power or an arbitrary exercise of it is really the demonstration of a reasonable nexus between the matters which are taken into account in exercising a power and the purposes of exercise of that power.\\nit was also reiterated that the decision in shree meenakshi mills case was based on a special agreement between the parties and therefore had no relevance to the question before them.\\nin prag ice oil mills v union of india 1978 3 scc 459 1978 indlaw sc 472 a

constitutional mandate if the basis adopted for price fixation was not shown to be so patently unreasonable as to be in excess of the power to fix the price.\\nhe observed in the ultimate analysis the mechanics of price fixation has necessarily to be left to the judgment of the executive and unless it is patent that there is hostiled discrimination against a class of operators the processual basis of price fixation has to be accepted in the generality of cases as valid.\\nreferring to shri meenakshi mills the learned cj reaffirmed the approval accorded to the statement in secretary of agriculture v central reig refining company supra that courts of law could not be converted into tribunals for relief from the crudities and inequities of complicated experimental economic legislation.\\npanipat sugar and anakappalle society were again referred to and it was pointed out that those cases turned on the language of section 33c of the essential commodities act.\\npremier automobiles was considered and it was affirmed that the judgment in that case could not be treated as precedent and could not afford any appreciable assistance in the decision of price fixation cases as it proceeded partly on agreement between the parties and partly on concessions made at the bar.\\nbeg cj.\\nwho delivered a separate opinion for himself and for desai j agreed that the judgment in premier automobiles was not to provide a precedent in price fixation case.\\nhe also reaffirmed the proposition that price fixation was in the nature of a legislative measure and could not give rise to a complaint that natural justice was not observed.\\nhe indicated the indicia which led him to the conclusion that price fixation was a legislative measure.\\nhe observed we think that unless by the terms of a particular statute or order price fixation is made a quasi judicial function for specified purposes or cases it is really legislative in character in the type of control order which is now before us because it satisfies the tests of legislation.\\na legislative measure does not concern itself with the facts of an individual case.\\nit is meant to lay down a general rule applicable to all persons or objects or transactions of a particular kind or class.\\nin the case before us the control order applies to sales of mustard oil anywhere in india by any dealer.\\nits validity does not depend on the observance of any procedure to be complied with or particular types of evidence to be taken on any specified matters as conditions precedent to its validity.\\nthe test of validity

taxes under the uttar pradesh municipalities act 1916.\\nit was held.\\nthe procedure for the imposition of the tax is legislative and not quasijudicial.\\nthe right to object however seems to be given at the stage of proposals of the tax only as a concession to requirements of fairness even though the procedure is legislative and not quasi judicial.\\nwe mentioned that the panipat and the anakapalle eases were distinguished in shree meenakshi and prag ice.\\npanipat and anakapalle were both cases where the question was regarding the price payable to a person who was required to sell to the government a certain percentage of the quantity of sugar produced in his mill.\\nthe order requiring him to sell the sugar to the government was made under section 32f of the essential commodities act under which the central government was enabled to make an order requiring any person engaged in the production of any essential commodity to sell the whole or specified part of the quantity produced by him to the government or its nominee.\\nit will straight away be seen that an order under section 32f if a specific order directed to a particular individual for the purpose of enabling the central government to purchase a certain quantity of the commodity from the person holding it.\\nit is an order for a compulsory sale.\\nwhen such a compulsory sale is required to be made under section 32f the question naturally arises what is the price to be paid for the commodity purchased.\\nsection 33c provides for the ascertainment of the price.\\nit provides that in calculating the amount to be paid for the commodity required to be sold regard is to be had to  a the minimum price if any fixed for sugarcane by the central government under this section b the manufacturing cost of sugar c the duty or tax if any paid or payable thereon and d the securing of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar.\\nit is further prescribed that different prices may be determined from time to time for different areas or for different factories or for different kinds of sugar.\\nit is to be noticed here that the payment to be made under section 33c is not necessarily the same as the controlled price which may be fixed under section 32c of the act.\\nsection 32c of the act we have already seen enables the central government to make an order controlling the price at which any essential commodity may be bought or sold if the central government is of opinion that it is necessary or expedient so to do for maintaining or increasing supplies of any essential commodity or in securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices.\\nsection 33c provides for the determination of the price to be paid to a person who has been directed by the central government by an order made under section 32c to sell a certain quantity of an essential commodity to the government or its nominee.\\nwhile section 32c contemplates an order of a general nature section 33c contemplates a specific transaction.\\nif the provisions of section 32c under which the price of an essential commodity may be controlled are contrasted with section 33c under which payment is to be made for a commodity require to be sold by an individual to the government the distinction between a legislative act and a non legislative act will at once become clear.\\nthe order made under section 32c which is not in respect of a single transaction nor directed to particular individual is clearly a legislative act while an order made under section 33c which is in respect of a particular transaction of compulsory sale from a specific individual is a non legislative act.\\nthe order made under section 32c controlling the price of an essential commodity may itself prescribe the manner in which price is to be fixed but that will not make the fixation of price a non legislative activity when the activity is not directed towards a single individual or transaction but is of a general nature covering all individuals and all transactions.\\nthe legislative character of the activity is not shed and an administrative or quasi judicial character acquired merely because guidelines prescribed by the statutory order have to be taken into account.\\nwe may refer at this juncture to some illuminating passages from schwrtz 's book on administrative law.\\nhe said if a particular function is termed legislative or rulemaking rather than judicial or adjudication it may have substantial effects upon the parties concerned.\\nif the function is treated as legislative in nature there is no right to notice and hearing unless a statute expressly requires them.\\nif a hearing is held in accordance with a statutory requirement it normally need not be a formal one governed by the requirements discussed in chapters 6 and 7.\\nthe characterization of an administrative act as legislative instead of judicial is thus of great significance.\\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx x as a federal court has recently pointed out there is no bright line between rule making and adjudication.\\nthe most famous pre apa attempt to explain the difference between legislative and judicial functions was made by justice holmes in prentis v atlantic coast line co a judicial inquiry said he investigates declares and enforces liabilities as they stand on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist.\\nthat is its purpose and end.\\nlegislation on the other hand looks to the future and changes existing conditions by making a new rule to be applied thereafter to all or some part of those subject to its power.\\nthe key factor in the holmes analysis is time a rule prescribes future patterns of conduct a decision determines liabilities upon the basis of present or past facts.\\nthe element of applicability has been emphasized by others as the key in differentiating legislative from judicial functions.\\naccording to chief justice burger rulemaking is normally directed toward the formulation of requirements having a general application to all members of a broadly identifiable class.\\nan adjudication on the other hand applies to specific individuals or situations.\\nrulemaking affects the rights of individuals in the abstract and must be applied in a further proceeding before the legal position of any particular individual will be definitely affected adjudication operates conceretly upon individuals in their individual x x capacity.\\nwe may now turn our attention to the two drugs prices control order of 1970 and 1979 both of which were made by the central government in exercise of its powers under section 3 of the essential commodities act.\\nthe drugs prices control order 1970 defined bulk drugs as follows bulk drugs means any unprecessed phamaceutical chemical biological and plant product or medicinal gas conforming to pharmacopocial or other standards accepted which is used as such or after being processed into formulations and includes an essential bulk drug.\\nbulk drugs were divided into essential bulk drugs which were included in the schedule and bulk drugs which were not so included.\\nin the case of essential bulk drugs paragraph 4 of the order enabled the central government to fix the maximum price at which such essential bulk drugs should be sold.\\nin the case of bulk drugs which were not included in the schedule a manufacturer was entitled to continue to market the product at the same price at which he was marketing the products at the time of the commencement of the order.\\nhe was required to report this price to the central government within two weeks of the commencement of the order and was further prohibited from increasing the price without obtaining the approval of the central government.\\na committee on drugs and pharmaceutical industry popularly known as the hathi committee was appointed by the government of india to enquire into the various facets of the drug industry in india.\\none of the terms of reference was to examine the measures taken so far to reduce prices of drugs for the consumer and to recommend such further measures as may be necessary to rationalise the prices of basic drugs and formulations.\\nthe hathi committee noticed that in a country like india where general poverty and the wide disparities in levels of income between different sections existed it was particularly important to emphasise the social utility of the industry and the urgent need for extending as rapidly as possible certain minimum facilities in terms of preventive and curative medicines to the large mass of people both urban and rural.\\nit was said the concern about drug prices therefore really arises from the fact that many of them are essential to the health and welfare of the community and that there is no justification for the drug industry charging prices and having a production pattern which is based not upon the needs of the community but on aggressive marketing tactices and created demand.\\nthe government of india accepted the report of the hathi committee and announced in parliament the statement on drug policy pursuant to which the drugs prices control order 1970 was repealed and the drugs prices control.\\norder 1979 was made.\\nparagraph 44 of the statement on drug policy in 1978 dealt with pricing policy and it may be usefully extracted here.\\nit was as follows.\\nthe hathi committee had recommended that a return post tax between 12 to 14 on equity that is paid up capital plus reserves may be adopted as the basis for price fixation depending on the importance and complexity of the bulk drug.\\nin the case of formulations the hathi committee felt that the principle of selectivity could be introduced in terms of a the size of the units b selection of items and c controlling the prices only of market leaders in particular of products for which price control is contemplated.\\nthe hathi committee considered that units other than mrtp units having only turnover of less than rs 1 crore may be exempted from price control.\\nalternatively all formulations other than those marketed under generic names which have an annual sale in the country in excess of rs 15 lakhs inclusive of excise duty may be subjected to price control irrespective of whether or not the total annual turnover of the unit is in excess of rs 1 crore.\\nthe ceiling price will be determined taking into account the production costs and a reasonable return for the units which are the market leaders.\\nyet another variant of a selectivity according to the hathi committee would be to identify product groups which individually are important and which collectively constitute the bulk of the output of the industry.\\nin respect of each item of this list it would be possible to identify the leading producers who account for about 60 of the sales between them.\\non the basis of cost analysis in respect of those units maximum prices may be prescribed and all other units may be free to fix their prices within this ceiling.\\non balance the hathi committee was of the view that this particular variant selectivity may be administratively simpler.\\nthe drugs prices control order 1979 was made pursuant to this statement of policy.\\nparagraph 2a of the drugs.\\nprices control.\\norder 1979 defines bulk drug to mean any substance including pharmaceutical chemical biological or plant product or medicinal gas conforming to pharmacological or other standards accepted under the drugs and cosmetics act 1940 which is used as such or as in ingredient in any formulations.\\nformulation is defined as follows formulation means a medicine processed out of or containing one or more bulk drugs or drugs with or without the use of any pharmaceutical aids for internal or external use for or in the diagnosis treatment mitigation or prevention of disease in human beings or animals but shall not include i any bona fide ayurvedic including sidha or unani tibb systems of medicine ii any medicine included in the homoeopathic system of medicine 865 iii any substance to which the provisions of the drugs and cosmetics act 1940 xxiii of 1940 do not apply.\\nthe expressions free reserve leader price net worth now bulk drug pooled price pre tax return retention price are defined in the following manner free reserve means a reserve created by appropriation of profits but does not include reserves provided for contingent liability disputed claims goodwill revaluation and other similar reserves.\\nleader price means a price fixed by the government for formulations specified in category i category ii or category iii of the third schedule in accordance with the provisions of paras.\\n10 and 11 keeping in view the cost of or efficiency or both of major manufacturers of such formulations.\\nnet worth means the share capital of a company plus free reserve if any.\\nnew bulk drug means a bulk drug manufactured within the country for the first time after the commencement of this order.\\npooled price in relation to a bulk drug means the price fixed under para 7.\\npre tax return means profits before payment of incometax and sur tax and includes such other expenses as do not form part of the cost of formulations.\\nretention price in relation to a bulk drug means the price fixed under paras 4 and 7 for individual manufacturers or importers or distributors or such bulk drugs.\\nthe distinction between an essential bulk drug included in the schedule and a bulk drug not so included in the schedule which was made in 1970 drugs prices control.\\norder was abandoned in the 1979 order.\\nbulk drugs were however broadly divided into indigenously manufactured bulk drugs imported bulk drugs and hulk drugs which were both manufactured indigenously as also imported.\\nparagraph 3 of the 1979 order enables the government with a view to regulating the equitable distribution of any indigenously manufactured bulk drug specified in the first or the second schedule and making it available at a fair price and after making such enquiry as it deems fit to fix from time to time by notification in the official gazette the maximum price at which the bulk drug shall be sold.\\ncl 2 of paragraph 3 provides that while so fixing the price of a bulk drug the government may take into account the average cost of production of such bulk drug manufactured by an efficient manufacturer and allow a reasonable return on net worth.\\nby way of an explanation efficient manufacturer is defined to mean a manufacturer i.\\nwhose production of such bulk drug in relation to the total production of such bulk drug in the country is large or ii who employs efficient technology in the production of such bulk drug.\\nwe have already noticed that net worth is defined to mean the share capital of a company plus free reserve if any.\\nfree reserve itself is separately defined.\\nit is then prescribed by clause 3 no person shall sell a bulk drug at a price exceeding the price notified under sub paragraph 1 plus local taxes if any payable provided that until the price of bulk drug is so notified the price of such bulk drug shall be the price which prevailed immediately before the commencement of this order and the manufacture of such bulk drug at a price exceeding the price which prevailed as aforesaid.\\nthis means that until the maximum sale price of an indigenously manufactured bulk drug is fixed under paragraph 3 of the 1979 order the price fixed under paragraph 4 of the 1970 order or the price permitted under paragraph 5 of the 1970 order was to be maximum sale price.\\nparagraph 34a requires a manufacturer commencing production of the bulk drug specified in the first or second schedule the price of which has already been notified by the government not to sell the bulk drug at a price exceeding the notified price.\\nparagraph 34b provides that where the price of a bulk drug has not been notified by the government the manufacturer shall within 14 days of the commencement of the the production of such bulk drug make an application to the government in form i and intimate the government the price at which he intends to sell the bulk drug and the government may after making such an enquiry as it thinks fit by order fix a provisional price at which such bulk drug shall be sold.\\nparagraph 4 of the 1979 order provides that notwithstanding anything contained in paragraph 3 the government may if it considers necessary or expedient so to do for increasing the production of an indigenously manufactured bulk drug specified in the first or second schedule by order fix a a retention price of such bulk drug b a common sale price for such bulk drug taking into account the weighted average of the retention price fixed under clause.\\nparagraph 4 is thus in the nature of an exception to paragraph 3.\\nit is meant to provide a fillip to individual manufacturers of bulk drugs whose production it is necessary to increase.\\nretention price by its very definition pertains to individual manufacturers.\\ncommon sale price we take it is the price at which manufacturers whose retentions are fixed may sell the bulk drug despite the maximum sale price fixed under paragraph 3.\\nparagraph 5 deals with the power of the government to fix maximum sale price of new bulk drugs.\\nparagraph 6 enables the government to fix the maximum sale price of imported bulk drugs specified

drugs prices control.\\norder was a legislative activity and therefore not subject to any principle of natural justice.\\nhe urged that relevant information was required to be furnished and was indeed furnished by all the manufacturers in the prescribed form as required by paragraph 34 of the drugs prices control order.\\nthis information obtained from the various manufacturers was taken into account and a report was then obtained from the bureau of industrial costs and prices a high powered expert body specially constituted to undertake the study of industrial cost structures and pricing problems and to advise the government.\\nit was only thereafter that notifications fixing the prices were issued.\\nhe further submitted that paragraph 27 of the central order gave a remedy to the manufacturers to seek a review of the order fixing the maximum price under paragraph 3.\\nthe review contemplated by paragraph 27 in so far as it related to the notification under paragraph 3 it was submitted by the learned additional solicitor general did not partake the character of a judicial or quasi judicial proceeding.\\nhe urged that the manufacturers had invoked the remedy by way of review but before the applications for review could be dealt with they rushed to the court with the writ petitions out of which the appeal and the special leave petitions arise.\\nhe urged that the government had always been ready and wilting to give a proper hearing to the parties and in fact gave them a heating in connection with their review applications.\\nthe grievance of the manufacturers in the writ petitions that they were not furnished the details of the basis of the price fixation was not correct since full information was furnished at the time of the hearing of the review applications when the matter underwent thorough and detailed discussion between the parties and the government as well as the bureau of industrial costs and prices.\\nthe submission of shri anil diwan learned counsel for the respondents was that unlike other price control legislations the drugs prices control order was designed to induce better production by providing for a fair return to the manufacturer.\\nreference was made to the hathi committee report which had recommended a return of 12 to 14 post tax return on equity that is paid up capital plus reserves and the statement on drug policy which mentioned that ceiling prices may be determined by taking into account production costs and a reasonable return.\\ngreat emphasis was laid on the second clause of paragraph 3 of the 1979 order which provides that in fixing the price of a bulk drug the government may take into account the average cost of production of such bulk drug manufactured by an efficient manufacturer and allow a reasonable return on networth.\\nit was submitted that the provision for an enquiry preceding the determination of the price of a bulk drug the prescription in paragraph 3 cl 2 that the average cost of production of the drug manufactured by an efficient manufacturer should be taken into account and that a reasonable return on networth should be allowed and the provision for a review of the order determining the price established that price fixation under the drugs prices control.\\norder 2979 was a quasijudicial activity obliging the observance of the rules of natural justice.\\nthe suggestion of the learned counsel was that the nature of the review under paragraph 27 was so apparently quasi judicial and that the need to know the reasons for the order sought to be reviewed was so real if the manufacturer was effectively to exercise his right to seek the quasijudicial remedy of review that by necessary implication it became obvious that the order fixing the maximum price must be considered to be quasijudicial and not legislative in character.\\nthe provision for enquiry in the first clause of paragraph 3 and the prescription of the matters to be taken into account in the second clause of paragraph 3 further strengthened the implication according to the learned counsel.\\nit was contended that in any case whatever be the nature of the enquiry and the order contemplated by paragraph 3 the review for which provision made by paragraph 27 was certainly of a quasijudicial character and therefore it was necessary that the manufacturers should be informed of the basis for the fixation of the price and furnished with details of the same in order that they may truly and effectively avail themselves of the remedy of review.\\nif that was not done the remedy would become illusory.\\nit was argued with reference to various facts and figures that the price had been fixed in an arbitrary manner and the government was not willing to disclose the basis on which the prices were fixed on the pretext that it may involve disclosure of matters of confidential nature.\\nit was stated that the applications of the manufacturers for review of the notifications fixing the prices had not been disposed of for years though time was really of the very essence of the matter.\\nthe prices of formulations were dependent on the prices of drugs and it was not right that prices of formulations should have been fixed even before the applications for review against the notifications fixing the price of bulk drugs were disposed of.\\nit was suggested that the delay in disposing of the review applications had the effect of rendering the original notifications fixing the prices unreal and out of date and liable to be struck down on that ground alone.\\nwe are unable to agree with the submissions of the learned counsel for the respondents either with regard to the applicability of the principles of natural justice or with regard to the nature and the scope of the enquiry and review contemplated by paragraphs 3 and 27 while making our preliminary observations we pointed out that price fixation is essentially a legislative activity though in rare circumstances as in the case of a compulsory sale to the government or its nominee it may assume the character of an administrative or quasijudicial activity.\\nnothing in the scheme of the drugs prices control.\\norder induces us to hold that price fixation under the drugs prices control.\\norder is not a legislative activity but a quasi judicial activity which would attract the observance of the principles of natural justice.\\nnor is there anything in the scheme or the provisions of the drugs prices control order which otherwise contemplates the observance of any principle of natural justice or kindred rule the non observance of which would give rise to a cause of action to a suitor.\\nwhat the order does contemplate however is such enquiry by the government as it thinks fit.\\na provision for such enquiry as it thinks fit by a subordinate legislating body we have explained earlier is generally an enabling provision to facilitate the subordinate legislating body to obtain relevant information from any source and it is not intended to vest any right in any body other than the subordinate legislating body.\\nin the present case the enquiry contemplated by paragraph 3 of drugs prices control.\\norder is to be made for the purposes of fixing the maximum price at which a bulk drug may be sold with a view to regulating its equitable distribution and making it available at a fair price.\\nthe primary object of the enquiry is to secure the bulk drug at a fair price for the benefit of the ultimate consumer an object designed to fulfil the mandate of article 39b of the constitution.\\nit is primarily from the consumer public 's point of view that the government is expected to make its enquiry.\\nthe need of the consumer public is to be ascertained and making the drug available to them at a fair price is what it is all about.\\nthe enquiry is to be made from that angle and directed towards that end.\\nso information may be gathered from whatever source considered desirable by the government.\\nthe enquiry obviously is not to be confined to obtaining information from the manufacturers only and indeed must go beyond.\\nhowever the interests of the manufacturers are not to be ignored.\\nin fixing the price of a bulk drug the government is expressly required by the order to take into account the average cost of production of such bulk drug manufactured by an efficient manufacturer and allow a reasonable return on net worth.\\nfor this purpose too the government may gather information from any source including the manufacturers.\\nhere again the enquiry by the government need not be restricted to an efficient manufacturer or some manufacturers nor need it be extended to all manufacturers.\\nwhat is necessary is that the average cost of production by an efficient manufacturer must be ascertained and a reasonable return allowed on net worth.\\nsuch enquiry as it thinks fit is an enquiry in which information is sought from whatever source considered necessary by the enquiring body and is different from an enquiry in which an opportunity is required to be given to persons likely to be affected.\\nthe former is an enquiry leading to a legislative activity while the latter is an enquiry which ends in an administrative or quasi judicial decision.\\nthe enquiry contemplated by paragraph 3 of the drug prices control.\\norder is an enquiry of the former character.\\nthe legislative activity being a subordinate or delegated legislative activity it must necessarily comply with the statutory conditions if any no more and no less and no implications of natural justice can be read into it unless it is a statutory condition.\\nnotwithstanding that the price fixation is a legislative activity the subordinate legislation had taken care here to provide for a review.\\nthe review provided by paragraph 27 of the order is akin to a post decisional hearing which is sometimes afforded after the making of some administrative orders but not truly so.\\nit is a curious amalgam of a hearing which occasionally precedes a subordinate legislative activity such as the fixing of municipal rates etc.\\nthat we mentioned earlier and a post decision hearing after the making of an administrative or quasi judicial order.\\nit is a hearing which follows a subordinate legislative activity intended to provide an opportunity to affected persons such as the manufacturers the industry and the consumer public to bring to the notice of the subordinate legislating body the difficulties or problems experienced or likely to be experienced by them consequent on the price fixation whereupon the government may make appropriate orders.\\nany decision taken by the government can not be confined to the individual manufacturer seeking review but must necessarily affect all manufacturers of the bulk drug as well as the consumer public.\\nsince the maximum price of a bulk drug is required by paragraph 3 to be notified any fresh decision taken in the proceeding for review by way of modification of the maximum price has to be made by a fresh notification fixing the new maximum price of the bulk drug.\\nin other words the review if it is fruitful must result in fresh subordinate legislative activity.\\nthe true nature of the review provided by paragraph 27 in so far as it relates to the fixation of maximum price of bulk drugs under paragraph 3 leader price and prices of formulations under paragraphs 12 and 13 is hard to define.\\nit is difficult to give it a label and to fit it into a pigeon hole legislative administrative or quasi judicial.\\nnor is it desirable to seek analogies and look to distant cousins for guidance.\\nfrom the scheme of the control order and the context and content of paragraph 27 the review in so far as it concerns the orders under paragraph 3 12 and 13 appears to be in the nature of a legislative review of legislation or more precisely a review of subordinate legislation by a subordinate legislating body at the instance of an aggrieved person.\\nonce we have ascertained the nature and character of the review the further question regarding the scope and extent of the review is not very difficult to answer.\\nthe reviewing authority has the fullest freedom and discretion to prescribe its own procedure and consider the matter brought before it so long as it does not travel beyond the parameters prescribed by paragraph 3 in the case of a review against an order under paragraph 3 and the respective other paragraphs in the case of other orders.\\nbut whatever procedure is adopted it must be a procedure tuned to the situation.\\nmanufacturers of any bulk drug are either one or a few in number and generally they may be presumed to be well informed persons well able to take care of themselves who have the assistance of accountants advocates and experts to advise and espouse their cause.\\nin the context of the drug industry with which we are concerned and in regard to which the control order is made we must proceed on the basis that the manufacturers of bulk drugs are generally persons who know all that is to be known about the price fixed by the government.\\nfrom the legislative nature of the activity of the government it is clear that the government is under no obligation to make any disclosure of any information received and considered by it in making the order but in order to render effective the right to seek a review given to an aggrieved person we think that the government if so requested by the aggrieved manufacturer is under an obligation to disclose any relevant information which may reasonably be disclosed pertaining to the average cost of production of the bulk drug manufactured by an efficient manufacturer and the reasonable return on net worth.\\nfor example the manufacturer may require the government to give information regarding the particulars detailed in form No 1 of the fourth schedule which have been taken into account and those which have been excluded.\\nthe manufacturer may also require to be informed the elements which were taken into account and those which were excluded in assessing the free reserves entering into the calculation of net worth.\\nthese particulars which he may seek from the government are mentioned by us only by way of illustration.\\nhe may seek any other relevant information which the government shall not unreasonably deny.\\nthat we think is the nature and scope of the review contemplated by paragraph 27 in relation to orders made under paragraphs 3 12 and 13.\\non the question of the scope of a review the learned counsel for the respondents invited our attention to vrajlal manilal co v union of india anr 1964 7 scr 97 1964 indlaw sc 194 shivaji nathubhai v union of india ors 1960 2 scr 775 1960 indlaw sc 430 maneka gandhi 1978 2 scr 621 1978 indlaw sc 212 swadeshi cotton mills 1981 2 scr 533 1981 indlaw sc 349 and liberty oil mills.\\n1984 3 scr 676 1984 indlaw sc 326.\\nwe are afraid none of these cases is of any assistance to the correspondence since the court was not concerned in any of those cases with a review of subordinate legislation by the subordinate legislating body.\\nin vrajlal manilal co v union of india anr 1964 indlaw sc 194 supra the court held that the union of india when disposing of an application for review under rule 59 of the mines concession rules functioned as a quasi judicial authority and was bound to observe the principles of natural justice.\\nthe decision rendered without disclosing the report of the state government and without affording reasonable opportunity to the appellants to present their case was contrary to natural justice was therefore void.\\nin shivaii nathubhai v union of india ors 1960 indlaw sc 430 supra it was decided by the court that the power of review granted to the central government under rule 54 of the mineral concession rules required the authority to act judicially and its decision would be a quasi judicial act and the fact that rule 54 gave power to the central government to pass such order as it may deem just and proper did not negative the duty to act judicially.\\nin maneka gandhi 's case where bhagwati j while expounding on natural justice pointed out that in appropriate cases where a pre decisional hearing was impossible there must atleast be a post decisional hearing so as to meet the requirement of the rule audi alteram partem.\\nin swadeshi cotton mills it was observed that in cases where owing to the compulsion of the fact situation or the necessity of taking speedy action no pre decisional hearing is given but the action is followed soon by a full post decisional hearing to the person affected there is in reality no exclusion of the audi alteram partem rule.\\nit is no adaptation of the rule to meet the situational urgency.\\nin liberty oil mills v union of india 1984 indlaw sc 326 supra the question arose whether clause 8b of the import control order which empowered the central government or the chief controller to keep in abeyance applications for licences or allotment of imported goods where any investigation is pending into an imported goods where any investigation is pending into an allegation mentioned in cl.\\n8 excluded the application of the principles of natural justice.\\nthe court pointed out that it would be impermissible to interpret a statutory instrument to exclude natural justice unless the language of the instrument left no option to the court.\\nas we said these cases have no application to a review of subordinate legislation by the subordinate legislating body at the instance of a party.\\nwe mentioned that the price fixed by the government may be questioned on the ground that the considerations stipulated by the order as relevant were not taken into account.\\nit may also be questioned on any ground on which a subordinate legislation may be questioned such as being contrary to constitutional or other statutory provisions.\\nit may be questioned on the ground of a denial of the right guaranteed by article 14 if it is arbitrary that is if either the guidelines prescribed for the determination are arbitrary or if even though the guidelines are not arbitrary the guidelines are worked in an arbitrary fashion.\\nthere is no question before us that paragraph 3 prescribes any arbitrary guideline.\\nit was however submitted that the guidelines were not adhered to and that facts and figures were arbitrarily assumed.\\nwe do not propose to delve into the question whether there has been any such arbitrary assumption of facts and figures.\\nwe think that if there is any grievance on that score the proper thing for the manufacturers to do is bring it to the notice of the government in their applications for review.\\nthe learned counsel argued that they were unable to bring these facts to the notice of the government as they were not furnished the basis on which the prices were fixed.\\non the other hand it has been pointed out in the counter affidavits filed on behalf of the government that all necessary and required information was furnished in the course of the hearing of the review applications and.\\nthere was no justification for the grievance that particulars were not furnished.\\nwe are satisfied that the procedure followed by the government in furnishing the requisite particulars at the time of the hearing of the review applications is sufficient compliance with the demands of fair play in the case of the class of persons claiming to be affected by the fixation of maximum price under the drugs prices control order.\\nas already stated by us manufacturers of bulk drugs who claim to be affected by the drugs prices control.\\norder belong to a class of persons who are well and fully informed of every intricate detail and particular which is required to be taken into account in determining the price.\\nin most cases they are the sale manufacturers of the bulk drug and even if they are not the sole manufacturers they belong to the very select few who manufacture the bulk drug.\\nit is impossible to conceive that they can not sit across the table and discuss item by item with the reviewing authority unless they are furnished in advance full details and particulars.\\nthe affidavits filed on behalf of the union of india show that the procedure which is adopted in hearing the review applications is to discuss across the table the various items that have been taken into account.\\nwe do not consider that there is anything unfair in the procedure adopted by the government.\\nif necessary it is always open to the manufacturers to seek a short adjournment of the hearing of the review application to enable them to muster more facts and figures on their side.\\nindeed we find that the hearing given to the manufacturers is often protected.\\nas we said we do not propose to examine this question as we do not want to constitute ourselves into a court of appeal over the government in the matter of price fixation.\\nhe learned counsel argued that there were several patent errors which came to light during the course of the hearing in the high court.\\nhe said that obsolete quantitative usages had been taken into consideration proximate cost data had been ignored and the data relating to the year ending november 1976 had been adopted as the basis.\\nit was submitted that there were errors in totalling errors in the calculation of prices of utilities errors in the calculation of net worth and many other similar errors.\\nas we pointed out earlier these are all matters which should legitimately be raised in the review application if there is any substance in them.\\nthese are not matters for investigation in a petition under article 226 of the constitution or under article 32 of the constitution.\\ndespite the pressing invitation of shri diwan to go into facts and figures and his elaborate submissions based on facts and figures we have carefully and studiously refrained from making any reference to such facts and figures as we consider it outside our province to do so and we do not want to set any precedent as was supposed to have been done in premier automobiles though it was not so done and therefore needed explanation in later cases.\\none of the submissions of shri diwan was that in calculating net worth the cost of new works in progress and the amount invested outside the business were excluded from free reserves and that such exclusion could not be justified on any known principle of accountancy.\\nwe think that the question has to be decided with reference to the definition of free reserve in paragraph 2g of the control order and not on any assumed principle of accountancy.\\nthis is also a question which may be raised before the government in the review application.\\nreferring to the proforma attached to form No 1 of the fourth schedule in which are set out several items which have to be taken into account in assessing the cost of production the learned counsel attacks the notes at the end of item No 14 which mentions the various items of expenses to be excluded in ascertaining the cost.\\nthe notes is as follows notes i items of expenses to be excluded from costs a bonus in excess of statutory minimum.\\nb bad debts and provisions.\\nc donations and charities.\\nd loss gain on sale of assets.\\ne brokerage and commission.\\nf expenses not recognized by income tax authorities salary prequisities advertisements etc.\\ng adjustments relating to previous years.\\nin particular he argued that item a bonus in excess of statutory minimum should not have been excluded so also items of expenditure coming under the other heads b to g which had been allowed by income tax authorities as legitimate expenses.\\nhis submission was that where bonus in excess of statutory minimum was payable under the provisions of the bonus act there was no option left to the manufacturer not to pay the excess bonus.\\nsimilarly where expenses have been legitimately incurred and allowed by income tax authorities there was no justification for excluding those items of expenditure from the cost.\\nwe do not agree with the submission.\\nit was open to the subordinate legislating body to prescribe and adopt its own mode of ascertaining the cost of production and the items to be included and excluded in so doing.\\nthe subordinate legislating body was under no obligation to adopt the method adopted by the income tax authorities in allowing expenses for the purpose of ascertaining income and assessing it.\\nthere may be many items of business expenditure which may be allowed by income tax authorities as legitimate expenses but which can never enter the cost of production.\\nso long as the method prescribed and adopted by the subordinate legislating body is not arbitrary and opposed to the principal statutory provisions it can not be legitimately questioned.\\nanother submission of the learned counsel relating to the norms for conversion costs packing charges and process loss of raw materials and packing materials required to the notified for the purpose of calculating retail prices of formulations.\\nthe argument for example was that there should be a more scientific formula in regard to conversion cost and not as was done so many rupees and paise per thousand capsules or one litre of liquid.\\nit is open to the subordinate legislating authority to adopt a rough and ready but otherwise not unreasonable formula rather than a needlessly intricate so called scientific formula.\\nwe are unable to say that the subordinate legislating authority acted unreasonably in prescribing the norms in the manner it has done.\\nwhile on the question on formulations we would like to refer to the oration of dr n h antia at the 24th annual convocation of the national academy of medical sciences where he posed the question why do we produce 60000 formulations of drugs worth rs 2500 crores which reach only 20 of the population when who recommends only 258 drugs and rs 750 crores worth would suffice for all our people if used in an ethical manner.\\na general submission of the learned counsel was that the price of formulations should not have been prescribed until the review application filed by the manufacturer in regard to the patent bulk drugs was disposed of.\\nhe submitted that the price of a formulation was dependant on the price of the bulk drug and it was therefore not right to fix the price of formulation when the price of bulk drug was in question in the review application and there was a prospect of the price of the bulk drug being increased.\\nwe do not see any force in the submission.\\nwe think that it is the necessary duty of the government to proceed to fix the retail price of a formulation as soon as the price of the parent bulk drug is fixed.\\nprice fixation of a formulation is no doubt dependant on the price of the bulk drug but it is not to await the result of a review application which in the end may turn out to be entirely without substance.\\nif a review application is allowed and the price of the bulk drug is raised and if in the meanwhile the formulation had been ordered to be sold at a low price it may result in considerable loss to the manufacturer.\\nbut on the other hand if the review application turns out to be entirely without substance and has to be rejected and if in the meanwhile the formulation is allowed to be sold at a higher price the consumer public suffers.\\nhus the ups and downs of commerce are inevitable and it is not possible to devise a fool proof system to take care of every possible defect and objection.\\nit is certainly not a matter at which the court could take a hand.\\nall that the court may do is to direct the government to dispose of the review application expeditiously according to a time bound programme.\\nall that the government may do is to dispose of the review application with the utmost expedition.\\nbut as we perceive the public interest it is necessary that the price of formulation should be fixed close on the heels of the fixation of bulk drug price.\\nanother submission of shri diwan was that there was considerable delay in the disposal of the review applications by the government and that even now no orders had been passed in several cases.\\naccordingly to the learned counsel the very delay in the disposal of review applications was sufficient to vitiate the entire proceeding and scheme of price fixation.\\naccording to the learned counsel the price of a bulk drug is dependant on many variable factors which keep changing very fast.\\nif time is allowed to lapse whatever price is fixed it soon becomes out of date.\\nif review applications are not disposed of expeditiously the notifications fixing the prices must be struck down as having become obsolete.\\nit is difficult to agree with these propositions.\\nit is true that the price of a bulk drug is dependent on innumerable variables.\\nbut it does not follow that the notification fixing the maximum price must necessarily be struck down as obsolete by the mere passage of time.\\nwe agree that applications for review must be dealt with expeditiously and whenever they are not so dealt with the aggrieved person may seek a mandamus from the court to direct the government to deal with the review application within a time framework.\\nwe notice that in all these matters the high court granted stay of implementation of the notifications fixing the maximum prices of bulk drugs and the retail prices of formulations.\\nwe think that in matter of this nature where prices of essential commodities are fixed in order to maintain or increase supply of the commodities or for securing the equitable distribution and availability at fair prices of the commodity it is not right that the court should make any interim order staying the implementation of the notification fixing the prices.\\nwe consider that such orders are against the public interest and ought not to be made by a court unless the court is satisfied that no public interest is going to be served.\\nin the present case on ex parte interim order was made on april 20 1981 in the following terms in the meanwhile on the petitioners giving an undertakings to maintain prices both for bulk and formulation as were prevailing prior to the impugned notification we stay implementation of the impugned bulk drug prices as well as formulation prices.\\nthereafter on november 25 1981 a further order was made to the following effect after hearing learned counsel and with their consent and arrangement has been worked out as on interim measure.\\nwe therefore confirm till further orders the interim order made by us on april 20 1981.\\nthe terms of the said order that is on the undertaking given on behalf of the petitioners to maintain status quo on the prices prevailing prior to the issue of the impugned notification the petitioners through their counsel further given an undertaking to this court that in case the petition is dismissed and the rule is discharged the petitioners shall within eight weeks of the dismissal of the petition by this court deposit in this court the difference in the prices of the formulations in question for being equalization account.\\nthe petitioners through their counsel further given an undertaking that in this court the petitioners would not contend or challenge the said amount if deposited is not liable to be deposited under any law whatsoever.\\nit is made clear that the undertaking is without prejudice to the petitioners right to take appropriate directions from the supreme court if so advised in this regard.\\nno doubt the order as made on november 25 1981 has the manufacturers on terms but the consumer public has been left high and dry.\\ntheir interests have in no way been taken care of.\\nin matters of fixation of price it is the interest of the consumer public that must come first and any interim order must take care of that interest.\\nit was argued by the learned counsel that the undertaking given by the parties lapsed with the disposal of the writ petition by the high court and that it could no longer be enforced.\\nwe do not agree with this submission.\\napart from the fact that an appeal is ordinarily considered to be a continuation of the original proceeding in the present case we notice that further orders of the supreme court were also in contemplation and such further orders could only be if appeals were preferred to the supreme court.\\nwe do not think that there was any doubt in anyone 's mind that the matter would be taken up in appeal to the supreme court whichever way the writ petitions were decided.\\nwe are of the view that the undertakings given by the parties in the present cases were intended to and do continue to subsist.\\non the conclusions arrived at by us we have no doubt that the appeal must be allowed and the writ petition in the high court dismissed.\\nhowever we think that it is necessary to give a direction to the government to dispose of the review applications after giving a notice of hearing to the manufacturer.\\nthe hearing may be given within two months from today and the review application disposed of within two weeks after the conclusion of the hearing.\\nany information sought by the manufacturer may be given to him at the hearing in terms of what we have said in the judgment.\\nthe union of india is entitled to the costs of the appeal and the writ petition in the high court.\\nit appears that although several writ petitions filed by different manufacturers were disposed of by the high court by a common judgment the union of india filed an appeal within the prescribed period of limitation against one of the manufacturers cynamide india limited only.\\nthis was apparently done under some misapprehension that it would be enough if a single appeal was filed.\\nlater when it was realized that separate appeals were necessary the union of india filed petitions for special leave to appeal against the other manufacturers also.\\nas these petitions were filed beyond the prescribed period of limitation petitions for condoning the delay in filing the petitions for special leave to appeal had to be and were filed.\\nthese applications are strenuously opposed by the manufacturers who contend the ordinary rule which is enforced in cases of delay namely that everyday 's delay must be properly explained should also be rigorously enforced against the government.\\nit is contended that the government is a well verse litigant as compared with private litigants and even if there is justification of adopting a liberal approach in condoning delay in the case of private litigants there was no need to adopt such approach in the case of the government.\\nin cases like the present where parties have acted on the assumption that no appeals had been filed against them and have proceeded to arrange their affairs accordingly it would be unjust to condone the delay in filing the appeals at the instance of the government.\\nthough we see considerable force in the submission of shri diwan we think that the circumstances of the instant cases do justify the exercise of our discretion to condone the delay.\\ntwo important features have weighed with us in condoning the delay.\\none is that all the writ petitions were disposed of by a common judgment and an appeal had been filed in the principal case.\\nthe other is that it is a matter of serious concern to the public interest.\\nwe therefore condone the delay grant special leave in all the petitions for special leave and direct the appeals to be listed for hearing on may 1 1987.\\norder accordingly.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

mayurani,a sri lankan student,who was residing in the first floor of the house belonging to one solsimalai (p.w.1).\\nthe accused is also a sri lankan student studying in a different college,but staying in the second floor of the same premises.\\nthe occurrence allegedly took place in the afternoon of 22.4.2003.\\nthe first information report was lodged by p.w.1 on 24-4-2003 at about 9.30 a.m.\\nit was indicated in the first information report that on 24.4.2003 at 9.00 a.m.,while the informant had gone to perform pooja in the first floor of the house,he got foul smell in the last room of the first floor and found blood seeping through the front door.\\non opening the window he noticed that mayurani was lying in a pool of blood with her face covered with a bag.on the basis of the aforesaid f.i.r.,investigation was taken up initially by p.w.40.\\nsubsequently on the basis of the order of the high court,such investigation was completed by p.w.42.\\nthe accused is stated to have been arrested on suspicion on 26.4.2003.\\non the basis of the statement of the accused,prosecution discovered many materials including a knife and a log allegedly used for killing.\\ninitially,p.w.40 suspected the role of p.w.1,his wife p.w.2,p.w.3,from whose house certain incriminating material were recovered allegedly on the basis of statement of the accused as well as p.w.4,who was working as a cleaner in the vehicle of p.w.1.subsequently,however,p.w.42,who took over investigation from p.w.40 filed charge-sheet only against the present appellant on the footing that p.ws.1 to 4 had no role to play in the crime.\\nchallenge in this appeal is to the order of a division bench of madras high court allowing the appeal filed by the respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 'accused').\\nthe accused was convicted for offence punishable under section 302 of the indian penal code,1860 (in short the 'ipc') and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of rs.10,000/-with default stipulation by principal district judge,madurai.\\n\\nANALYSIS\\nin bhagat ram v.state of punjab (air 1954 sc 621 1954 indlaw sc 188),it was laid down that where the case depends upon the conclusion drawn from circumstances the cumulative effect of the circumstances must be such as to negative the innocence of the accused and bring the offences home beyond any reasonable doubt.\\nin state of u.p.v.ashok kumar srivastava,(1992 crl.lj 1104 1992 indlaw sc 107),it was pointed out that great care must be taken in evaluating circumstantial evidence and if the evidence relied on is reasonably capable of two inferences,the one in favour of the accused must be accepted.\\nit was also pointed out that the circumstances relied upon must be found to have been fully established and the cumulative effect of all the facts so established must be consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt.\\nthere is no doubt that conviction can be based solely on circumstantial evidence but it should be tested by the touch-stone of law relating to circumstantial evidence laid down by the this court as far back as in 1952.\\nthe main circumstances relied upon by the prosecution relates to the statements of the accused leading to discovery of materials facts,admissible under section 27 of the indian evidence act,1872 (in short the 'evidence act').\\nthe scope and ambit of section 27 of the evidence act had been stated and restated in several decisions of this court.\\nat one time it was held that the expression \\\"fact discovered\\\" in the section is restricted to a physical or material fact which can be perceived by the senses,and that it does not include a mental fact,now it is fairly settled that the expression \\\"fact discovered\\\" includes not only the physical object produced,but also the place from which it is produced and the knowledge of the accused as to this,as noted in pulukuri kottaya's case 1946 indlaw pc 23.\\nin rammi alias rameshwar v.state of madhya pradesh (air 1999 sc 3544 1999 indlaw sc 1512) the scope and ambit of section 27 of the evidence act was analysed in great detail and it was concluded in para 12 as follows.\\ntrue,such information is admissible in evidence under section 27 of the evidence act,but admissibility alone would not render the evidence,pertaining to the above information,reliable.\\nwhile testing the reliability of such evidence the court has to see whether it was voluntarily stated by the accused.\\nthe alleged statement made by the accused led to discovery of knife,bloodstained clothes,rope,etc.\\nunfortunately,for the prosecution there is no evidence to show that in fact the wearing apparels containing bloodstains belonged to the accused,save and except the alleged confessional statement.\\nno witness has spoken that those clothes were worn by the accused at any time far less at or about the time of occurrence.\\nit is also to be kept in view that those articles were recovered from the house of p.w.3 and at the initial stage of investigation,p.w.3 himself was one of the suspected person and he was arrested.\\ntherefore,the statement of p.w.3 and his mother that those articles were brought by the accused and left in the upstairs room is to be considered with a pinch of salt\\nmoreover,there is nothing to indicate that in fact the bloodstained clothes and rope had tallied with the blood grouping of the deceased.\\nthe knife did not contain any bloodstain.\\ntherefore,the aspect relating to recovery of articles from the house of p.w.3 and his mother cannot be considered as a link to complete the chain of circumstantial evidence.\\nthe evidence of p.ws.17,18 and 19 is relevant.\\nsince the golden jewellery had been molten and were recovered in the shape of ingots,it would be very hazardous to come to the conclusion that in fact the golden jewellery belonged to the deceased.\\nif the accused had killed the deceased and stolen those golden jewellery,there is no reason as to why he had also not taken ear rings from the deceased.\\nthe fact that ear rings were on the dead body is admitted by the prosecution.\\nthe fact that there had been a statement allegedly made by p.w.1 leading to recovery of a parallel key from the dash board of the car of p.w.1,cannot be lost sight of.\\nfinal however,the very suspicious role of p.w.40,who apparently was in possession of at least two keys of the same lock creates suspicion regarding recovery of another key after 5 months.\\nlaw is well settled that when the prosecution relies upon circumstantial evidence,all the links in the chain of circumstances must be complete and should be proved through cogent evidence\\nwhen the judgment of the high court is analysed in the background of what has been stated by this court as regards circumstantial evidence,the inevitable conclusion is that the impugned judgment of the high court does not suffer from any infirmity to warrant interference.\\n\\nSTATUTE\\nsection 302 ipc, 1860.\\n\\n\",\n          \"FACTS\\nthe appellant is a trust which wanted to establish a self-financing engineering college and submitted an application to the university of kerala as well as to all india council for technical education (hereinafter called the 'aicte').\\nthere was an inspection by a team of professors of the university and it recommended favourably when it stated that the facilities provided by the appellant would be sufficient for establishing an engineering college.\\nthe aicte sent a communication stating that on the basis of the observations made by the expert committee and the recommendations made by the central regional committee,state level committee and central task force as per the provisions of the aicte regulation,the aicte was granting conditional approval for establishing an engineering and technical college.\\nin the event of contravention of the conditions,guidelines,norms and regulations of the aicte,the aicte could withdraw the approval at any time.\\nunder the impression that the state govt.was to grant permission,the appellant requested the state government for permission to start the college.\\nmeanwhile,the mahatma gandhi university by their letter dated forwarded to the government a list of colleges and courses for affiliation during that academic year.\\nthe appellant's college was shown as one of the colleges among the affiliated colleges for the said period.\\nthe appellant sent a reminder to the government for permission for starting the college for that academic year and ultimately the government refused permission by informing the appellant by a letter.\\nthereafter,the appellant filed writ petition for quashing the said order and for a direction to sanction and establish an engineering college.\\n\\nARGUMENT\\nlearned senior counsel appearing for the state fishery development corporation ltd.contended that a compromise decree between the parties in a suit for partition will not in army way affect the rights of the state in respect of the fisheries whether such rights the state acquires by virtue of an order of requisition under the requisition act or by virtue of any other statutory provisions under which the fisheries right vest in the state.\\nit was further contended that this court while giving affect to the compromise arrived at between the sarkar family made it explicitely clear that the said compromise will not in any way affect the rights of the state over the fisheries even if those fisheries agreed to be divided between the parties and in that view of the matter and the state of west bengal having already requisitioned the nalban fishery and having taken possession of the same the receiver could not have taken possession of the said nalban fishery pursuant to the order of this court appointing the collector 24 parganas as receiver and. under the circumstances the said receiver rightly intimated this court about the mistake committed by him and re-delivered possession of nalban fishery to the state of west bengal.\\ncontended that the order of the high court of hon'ble mr. justice deepak kumar sen dated 23.9.1980 directing the receiver to allow m/s. ghose and saha surveyors to make proper demarcation in the nalban fishery dividing the same in two lots and thereafter carry out the directions of the supreme court in respect thereof has become final,the same not having been challenged by the state of west. bengal and therefore,it would not be open for the said state in application for execution of the decree to raise the question of vesting of the nalban fishery with the state and the court would not interfere with the direction given by the learned single judge and division bench of the calcutta high court.\\n\\nISSUE\\n(1) whether in view of the judgment of this court in state of tamil nadu &amp; another v.adhiyaman educational &amp; research institute &amp; others,[1995] 4 scc 104 1995 indlaw sc 1631,the provisions of the aicte act,1987 occupied the field and it was not necessary to obtain the further approval of the government or other authority? whether any statute in the state of kerala if it required such approval,would be void?\\n(2) whether the orders of rejection passed by the state government were valid on merits and whether the university should have granted further orders to continue the affiliation solely on the basis of the aicte permission?\\n\\nANALYSIS\\nthe aicte act,1987 was an act to provide for the establishment of all india council for technical education with a view to the proper planning and coordinated development of the technical education system throughout the country,the promotion of qualitative improvement of such education in relation to planned quantitative growth and the regulation and proper maintenance of norms and standards in the technical education system and for matters connected therewith.\\nsub-cl.10 of regulation 8 states that the decision of the council shall be communicated to the state government concerned or the ugc,as the case may be,the concerned university or the state board,the regional office and the applicant before 30th april in case the application was made before the preceding 31st december.\\nin the above matter,the state of tamil nadu granted permission to all private managements to start private engineering colleges without financial commitment to government but subject to conditions.\\nat that time,the aicte act was not on the statute book.\\nthe government of tamil nadu granted permission to the trust for the academic year 1987-88 to start an engineering college.\\ns.10 of the madras university act,1923 dealt with various matters (including granting approval for starting new technical institutions),and that so far as these matters were concerned.\\nit is not the university act and the university but it is the central act and the council created under it which will have the jurisdiction.\\nto that extent,after the coming into force of the central act,the provisions of the university act will be deemed to have become unenforceable.\\nbecause of s.10(k) of the central act which vested the powers of granting approval in the council,the t.n.act of 1976 and the university act,1923 could not deal with any questions of 'approval' for establishment of technical institutions.\\nin the tamil nadu case,s.10(k) of the aicte act was referred to and the power of 'approval' for establishing a technical institution was considered,in our opinion,even if there was a state law in the state of kerala which required the approval of the state government for establishing technical institutions,such a law would have been repugnant to the aicte act and void to that extent,as held in the tamil nadu case.\\nsub-cl.(1) of cl.(9) of the kerala university first statute required \\\"verification of the facilities that may exist for starting the new colleges/course\\\".\\nthe commission was to inspect the site, verify the title deeds as regards the proprietary right of the management over the land (and buildings, if any) offered, building accommodation provided, if any, assets of the management, constitution of the registered body and all other relevant matters.\\nsub-cl.(2) of cl.(9) of kerala university first statute stated that the affiliation \\\"shall depend upon the fulfilment by the management of all the conditions for the satisfactory establishment and maintenance of the proposed institutional courses of studies and on the reports of inspection by the commission or commissions which the university may appoint for the purpose.\\nthe procedure for obtaining the affiliation and any conditions which could be imposed by the university,could not be inconsistent with the provisions of the central act.\\nthe university could not,therefore,in any event have sought for 'approval' of the state government.\\nthe state government in its counter then gave the names of the existing colleges and their location.\\nthe court observed that there was widespread student prospects against starting new colleges and it was necessary to be cautious in the matter of starting new engineering colleges.\\ngovernment could not initially take a decision on the appellant's affiliation because of elections and that matter being one of 'major policy' the government had subsequently \\\"taken a policy decision not to sanction any affiliation to such colleges either in the private sector or in the public sector for this year.\\nin thirwnuruga kirupan and variyar thavathiru sundara swamigal medical education &amp; charitable trust v.state of tamil nadu &amp; others,[1996] 3 scc 15 1996 indlaw sc 858,which was a case relating to medical education and which also related to the effect of a central law upon a law made by the state under entry 25 list iii,it was held that the \\\"essentiality certificate cannot be withheld by the state government on any policy consideration because the policy in the matter of establishment of a new medical college now vests with the central government alone\\\".\\nafter an approval was granted by the aicte or if the state felt that some conditions attached to the permission and required by the aicte to be complied with,were not complied with,then the state government could always write to the aicte,to enable the latter to take appropriate action.\\nthe only requirement as per the statute 9(7) was for the university to obtain the \\\"views\\\" of the state government.obtaining the 'views' of the state government,as already stated,did not amount to obtaining its 'approval'.\\nprocedure and conditions for affiliation could not be inconsistent with the provisions of the central act,in particular s.10(k) of the regulation,and the university could not seek approval of government.\\nthe university was also one of the agencies consulted by the council of the aicte under regulation 8.\\nthe approval of the aicte was sufficient.\\nthe direction to the mahatma gandhi university to consider the application of the appellant for final affiliation or continuance of affiliation is confirmed and this is to be done on the basis of the approval granted by the aicte,or any other relevant factors in the university act or its statutes,which are not inconsistent with the aicte act or its regulations.\\n\\nSTATUTE\\nu/s.10 of the aicte act,1987,it is stated that it is the duty of the council constituted under the act to take all steps as the said council might think fit for ensuring coordinated and integrated development of technical education and maintenance of standards.\\nsubcl.(k) of s.10(1) of aicte act,1987  provides that the council might \\\"grant approval for starting new technical institutions and for introduction of new courses or programmes in consultation with the agencies concerned.\\nsub-cl.(1) of aicte act,1987 permits the council to advice the central government in certain respects,sub-cl.(m)\\ns.11 of aicte act,1987 deals with inspection.\\nregulations have been framed by the aicte in exercise of powers conferred on it by s.23(1) of the aicte

financial position, sub-cl.2 with the courses or programmes and sub-cl.3 deals with the power of admissions and sub-cl.4 with tuition fees etc.and sub-cl.5 with the staff and sub-cl.6 with the governing body of the private institutions and subcl.7 with other matters.\\nregulation 8 deals with scrutiny of applications.\\ncl.9(7) of the kerala university first statute.\\n\\n\",\n          \"FACTS\\nthe price which the manufacturer of barlagan kotone, reported to the central government in 1971 was rs.24,735.68 per kg.\\nafter the 1979 drugs (prices control. order came into force, the distinction between essential and non-essential bulk drugs was abolished and a maximum price had to be fixed for barlagan ketone also like other bulk drugs.\\nthe manufacturer applied for fixation of price at rs.8,500 per kg.\\narmed with authority under the drugs (prices control. order, 1979 the central government issued notifications fixing the maximum prices at which various indigenously manufactured bulk drugs may be sold by the manufacturers.\\nthese notifications were questioned on several grounds by the manufacturers and they have been quashed by the delhi high court on the ground of failure to observe the principles of natural justice.\\n\\nARGUMENT\\nshri g. ramaswamy, learned additional solicitor general on behalf of the union of india, submitted that the fixation of maximum price under paragraph 3 of the drugs (prices control. order was a legislative activity and, therefore, not subject to any principle of natural justice.\\nhe urged that relevant information was required to be furnished and was indeed furnished by all the manufacturers in the prescribed form as required by paragraph 3(4) of the drugs (prices control) order.\\nhe urged that the government had always been ready and wilting to give a proper hearing to the parties and in fact gave them a heating in connection with their review applications.\\nthe learned counsel argued that there were several patent errors which came to light during the course of the hearing in the high court.\\none of the submissions of shri diwan was that in calculating \\\"net-worth\\\" the cost of new works in progress and the amount invested outside the business were excluded from 'free reserves' and that such exclusion could not be justified on any known principle of accountancy.\\nanother submission of the learned counsel relating to the norms for conversion costs, packing charges and process loss of raw materials and packing materials required to the notified for the purpose of calculating retail prices of formulations.\\na general submission of the learned counsel was that the price of formulations should not have been prescribed until the review application filed by the manufacturer in regard to the patent bulk drugs was disposed of.\\nhe submitted that the price of a formulation was dependant on the price of the bulk drug and it was, therefore, not right to fix the price of formulation when the price of bulk drug was in question in the review application and there was a prospect of the price of the bulk drug being increased.\\n\\nISSUE\\nthe problem is that of high prices, bearing, it is said, little relation to the cost of production to the manufacturers.\\n\\nANALYSIS\\n'price-fixation is neither the function nor the forte of the court.\\nthe second observation made  is, legislative action, plenary or subordinate, is not subject to rules of natural justice.\\nin the case of parliamentary legislation, the proposition is self-evident.\\nin the case of subordinate 'legislation, it may happen that parliament may itself provide for a notice and for a hearing-there are several instances of the legislature requiring the subordinate legislating authority to give public notice and a public hearing before say, for example, levying a municipal rate--,in which case the substantial non-observance of the statutorily prescribed mode of observing natural justice may have the effect of invalidating the subordinate legislation.\\nany attempt to draw a distinct line between legislative and administrative functions, it has been said, is 'difficult in theory and impossible in practice.\\na price fixation measure does not concern itself with the interests of an individual manufacturer or producer.\\nit is generally in relation to a particular commodity or class of commodities or transactions.\\nit is a direction of a general character, not directed against a particular situation.\\nit is intended to operate in the future. it is conceived in the interests of the general consumer public.\\nthe right of the citizen to obtain essential articles at fair prices and the duty of the state to so provide them are transformed into the power of the state to fix prices and the obligation of the producer to charge n6 more than the price fixed. viewed from whatever angle, the angle of general application the prospectivity of its effect, the public interest served, and the rights and obligations flowing therefrom, there can be no question that price fixation is ordinarily a legislative activity.\\npricefixation may occasionally assume an administrative or quasi-judicial character when it relates to acquisition or requisition of goods or property from individuals and it becomes necessary to fix the price separately in relation to such individuals.\\nin shree meenakshi mills ltd. v. union of india, [1974. 1 scc 468 1973 indlaw sc 291 a notification fixing the ex-factory price of certain counts of cotton yarn was questioned on the ground that the price had been arbitrarily fixed.\\nif the prices of yarn or cloth were fixed in such a way to enable the manufacturer or producer recover his cost of production and secure a reasonable margin of profit, no aspect of infringement of any fundamental right could be said to arise.\\nit was to be remembered that the mere fact that some of those were engaged in the industry, trade or commerce alleged'that they were incurring loss would not render the law stipulating the price unreasonable.\\nin laxmi khandsari v. state of uttar pradesh, [1981] 2 scc 600 1981 indlaw sc 558 it was held that the sugar cane control order, 1966 was a legislative measure and therefore, rules of natural justice were not attracted.\\nin rameshchandra kachardas porwal v. state of maharashtra, [1981] 2 scc 722 1981 indlaw sc 423 it was observed that legislative activity did not invite natural justice and that making of a declaration that a certain place shall be a principal market yard for a market area under the relevant agricultural produce markets acts was an act legislative in character.\\nthe observation of magarry, j. in bates v. lord hailsha, of st. marylebone [1972. 1 wlr 1973 that the rules of natural justice do not run in the sphere of legislation, primary or delegated, was cited with approval and two well known text books writers paul kackson and wades h.w.r. were also quoted.\\nit is further prescribed that different prices may be determined, from time to time, for different areas or for different factories or for different kinds of sugar.\\nit is to be noticed here that the payment to be made under s. 3(3c) is not necessarily the same as the controlled price which may be fixed under s. 3(2)(c) of the act.\\na committee on drugs and pharmaceutical industry, popularly known as the hathi committee was appointed by the government of india to enquire into the various facets, of the drug industry in india.\\none of the terms of reference was 'to examine the measures taken so far to reduce prices of drugs for the consumer, and to recommend such further measures as may be necessary to rationalise the prices of basic drugs and formulations.\\nthe hathi committee noticed that 'in a country like india where general poverty and the wide disparities in levels of income between different sections existed' it was particularly important to emphasise 'the social utility of the industry and the urgent need for extending as rapidly as possible certain minimum facilities in terms of preventive and curative medicines to the large mass of people both urban and rural.\\nthe distinction between an essential bulk drug included in the schedule and a bulk drug not so included in the schedule, which was made in 1970 drugs (prices control. order was abandoned in the 1979 order.\\nbulk drugs were, however, broadly divided into indigenously manufactured bulk drugs, imported bulk drugs and hulk drugs which were both manufactured indigenously as also imported.\\nnothing in the scheme of the drugs (prices control. order induces us to hold that price fixation under the drugs (prices control. order is not a legislative activity, but a quasi-judicial activity which would attract the observance of the principles of natural justice.\\nnor is there anything in the scheme or the provisions of the drugs (prices control) order which otherwise contemplates the observance of any principle of natural justice or kindred rule, the non-observance of which would give rise to a cause of action to a suitor.\\nwhat the order does contemplate however is 'such enquiry' by the government 'as it thinks fit.\\nthe primary object of the enquiry is to secure the bulk drug at a fair price for the benefit of the ultimate consumer an object designed to fulfil the mandate of art. 39(b) of the constitution\\nit is primarily from the consumer public's point of view that the government is expected to make its enquiry.\\nthe need of the consumer public is to be ascertained and making the drug available to them at a fair price is what it is all about.\\nthe enquiry is to be made from that angle and directed towards that end.\\nso, information may be gathered from whatever source considered desirable by the government.\\nthe price fixed by the government may be questioned on the ground that the considerations stipulated by the order as relevant were not taken into account.\\nit may also be questioned on any ground on which a subordinate legislation may be questioned, such as, being contrary to constitutional or other statutory provisions.\\nit may be questioned on the ground of a denial of the right guaranteed by art. 14 if it is arbitrary, that is, if either the guidelines prescribed for the determination are arbitrary or if, even though the guidelines are not arbitrary, the guidelines are worked in an arbitrary fashion.\\nthese are all matters which should legitimately be raised in the review application, if there is any substance in them.\\nthese are not matters for investigation in a petition under art. 226 of the constitution or under art. 32 of the constitution.\\ndespite the pressing invitation of shri diwan to go into facts and figures and his elaborate submissions based on facts and figures, we have carefully and studiously refrained from making any reference to such facts and figures as we consider it outside our province to do so and we do not want to set any precedent as was supposed to have been done in premier automobiles though it was not so done and, therefore, needed explanation in later cases.\\nthe question has to be decided with reference to the definition of 'free reserve' in paragraph 2(g) of the control order and not on any assumed principle of accountancy.\\nthis is also a question which may be raised before the government in the review application.\\nit was open to the subordinate legislating body to prescribe and adopt its own mode of ascertaining the cost of production and the items to be included and excluded in so doing.\\nthe subordinate legislating body was under no obligation to adopt the method adopted by the income-tax authorities in allowing expenses for the purpose of ascertaining income and assessing it.\\nthere may be many items of business expenditure which may be allowed by income-tax authorities as legitimate expenses but which can never enter the cost of production.\\nso long as the method prescribed and adopted by the subordinate legislating body is not arbitrary and opposed to the principal statutory provisions, it cannot be legitimately questioned.\\nany information sought by the manufacturer may be given to him at the hearing in terms of what we have said in the judgment.\\n\\nSTATUTE\\nit must be remembered that art. 39(b) of  the essential commodities act enjoins a duty on the state towards securing 'that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good.\\nthe essential commodities act is a legislation towards that end. s. 3(1) of the essential commodities act enables the central government, if it is of opinion 'that it is necessary or expedient so to do for maintaining or increasing supplies of any essential commodity or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair price', to 'provide for regulating or prohibiting by order, the production, supply and distribution thereof and trade and commerce therein.\\nin particular, s. 3(2)(c) enables the central government, to make an order providing for controlling the price at which any essential commodity may be bought or sold.\\nit is in pursuance of the powers granted to the central government by the essential commodities act that first the drugs (prices control. order, 1970 and later the drugs (prices control. order, 1979 were made.\\ns. 3(3c) provides for the ascertainment of the price.\\nit provides that in calculating the amount to be paid for the commodity required to be sold regard is to be had to--(a) the minimum price, if any, fixed for sugarcane by the central government under this section; (b) the manufacturing cost of sugar; (c) the duty or tax, if any, paid or payable thereon; and (d) the securing of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar.\\ns. 3(2)(c) of the act, we have already seen, enables the central government to make an order controlling the price at which any essential commodity may be bought or sold, if the central government is of opinion that it is necessary or expedient so to do for maintaining or increasing supplies of any essential commodity or in securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices.\\ns. 3(3c) provides for the determination of the price to be paid to a person who has been directed by the central government by an order made under s. 3(2)(c) to sell a certain quantity of an essential commodity to the government or its nominee.\\nthe drugs (prices control) order, 1970 defined 'bulk drugs' as follows: \\\"bulk drugs\\\" means \\\"any unprecessed phamaceutical, chemical, biological and plant product

1993 appellant is said to have commenced its business of manufacturing and selling centrifugal pumps also under the mark field marshall \\nallegedly on the premise that the first respondent is the proprietor of the said mark by reason of long user and thus acquired a reputation in that behalf a legal notice was issued upon it questioning its right to use the said mark in respect of centrifugal pumps by the appellant laying a claim that it had been using the said mark since 1963 \\nrespondent no 1 thereafter filed a suit in the delhi high court for grant of a decree of permanent injunction

party of the second part has satisfied the party of the first part of having used the mark field marshal in respect of centrifugal pumps and valves since 1973 \\nindisputably first respondent filed an application under section 4656 and 107 of the act marked as c o no 9 of 1986contending that m s jain industries having not used the trade mark in respect of centrifugal pumps for a period more than five years and one month the mark should be taken off the register \\nit claimed user of the said mark since 1963 and sought for rectification of the register by expunging the expression circulation

accordingly filed as withdrawn leaving the parties to bear their own costs \\na fresh application was filed by the first respondent \\nthe said m s jain industries however was not impleaded as a party therein \\nthe cause of action therefor was stated to have arisen in the following circumstances that the cause of action for the present petition arose in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents in the month of january 1987 when the respondent informed this honourable court that they have been recorded as subsequent proprietors of the impugned registered trade mark no 228867 in class 7 in c o no 9 of 1986whereupon the petitioner withdrew the said earlier petition c o no 9 of 1986 with permission of the court to file the present petition because of the changed circumstances \\nthe cause of action is continuous from day to day till the impugned registration is cancelled rectified \\nthe injunction matter in suit no 2408 of 1985 came up for hearing before a learned single

said trade mark no case for grant of injunction has been made out the interim order of injunction passed on 19 12 1985 was vacated and the defendants were permitted to use their registered trade mark subject to the following conditions a defendants will not use the logo style of the word field marshal of which logo and style the plaintiff is the proprietor under the copyright act \\nb defendants shall mention the name of the defendant firm thukral mechanical works sirhind on each and every centrifugal pump manufactured by them and sold in the name of field marshal \\nc the defendants shall maintain proper accounts of the sale of centrifugal pumps under the trade mark field marshal and shall file them in court as and when directed \\ncorrectness or otherwise of the said order has not been questioned \\nthe second rectification application filed by the first respondent however was transferred to the intellectual property appellate board \\nthe said application was dismissed \\na writ petition was filed there against by the first respondent \\na learned single judge of the delhi high court however refused to stay the operation of the order of the board dated 27 10 2004 an appeal was preferred there against \\nthe division bench of the high court thereafter while disposing of both the writ petition and the letters patent appeal allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of the board and directed it to adjudicate the dispute on merits \\nthe said order of the division bench is under challenge in this appeal \\nthe core question which arises for our consideration is as to whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case the application under s 461b was maintainable \\nbefore adverting thereto we may take notice of the relevant statutory provisions ss 461b481482 and 56 read as under section 46 removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non use  1 subject to the provisions of section 47a registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application made in the prescribed manner to a high court or to the registrar by any person aggrieved on the ground either a b that up to a date one month before the date of the application a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being provided that except where the applicant has been permitted under sub s 3 of s 12 to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of the goods in question or where the tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark the tribunal may refuse an application u cl a or cl b in relation to any goods if it is shown that there has been before the relevent date or during the relevant period as the case may be bona fide use of the trade mark by any proprietor thereof for the time being in relation to goods of the same description being goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered \\nsection 48 registered users  1 subject to the provisions of section 49a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as the registered user thereof in respect of any or all of the goods in respect of which the trademark is registered otherwise than as a defensive trade mark but the central government may by rules made in this behalf provide that no application for registration as such shall be enertained unless the agreement between the parties complies with the conditions laid down in the rules for preventing trafficking in trade marks \\nthe permitted use of a trade mark shall be deemed to be used by the proprietor thereof and shall be deemed not to be used by a person other than the proprietor for the purposes of s 46 or for any other purpose for which such use is material under this act or any other law \\nsection 56 power to cancel or vary registration and to rectify the register  1 \\non application made in the prescribed manner to a high court or to the registrar by any person aggrieved the tribunal may make such order as it may think fit for cancelling or varying the registration of a trade mark on the ground of any contravention or failure to observe a condition entered on the register in relation thereto \\nany person aggrieved by the absence or omission from the register of any entry or by any entry made in the register without sufficient cause or by any entry wrongly remaining on the register or by any error of defect in any entry in the register may apply in the prescribed manner to a high court or to the registrar and the tribunal may make such order for making expunging or varying the entry as it may think fit \\nthe tribunal may in any proceeding under this section decide any question that may be necessary or expedient to decide in connection with the rectification of the register \\nthe tribunal of its own motion may after giving notice in the prescribed manner to the parties concerned and after giving them an opportunity of being heard make any order referred to in sub s 1 or sub s 2 \\nany order of the high court rectifying the register shall direct that notice of the rectification shall be served upon the registrar in the prescribed manner who shall upon receipt of such notice rectify the register accordingly \\nthe power to rectify the register conferred by this section shall include the power to remove a trade mark registered in part a of the register to part b of the register \\nindisputably the scope of the provisions for removal from register in terms of s 46 and 56 of the act stand on different footings \\nwhereas s 46 had a limited application s 56 of the act is wider in nature \\nconcededly cl a of sub s 1 of s 46 is not attracted in the case \\nfor the purpose of appreciation of the rival contentions we may notice the findings of the board as also the high court \\nthe board has taken the view that the period of five years and one month will begin to run from the date on which thukral became the proprietor of the trademark that is30th may1986 and therefore the rectification application could have been filed by the appellant only sometime in 1991 opining that an application for rectification against the appellant within a period of seven and a half months from the date of assignment of the trade mark was not maintainable the application was dismissed \\nthe high court on the other hand opined it was not anybody  s case before us that m s jain industries \\nthe registered proprietor of the trademark used it at all \\nthe trademark was used by the appellant and thukral neither of whom were proprietors thereof except that thukral claims to have become its proprietor with effect from 30th may1986 according to learned counsel for the appellant the use of the trademark by thukral was not legally permissible use inasmuch as thukral did not have the consent tacit or otherwise of m s jain industries to use the trademark \\nif thukral did then it can not be said that there was no bona fide use thereof by its proprietor \\nthat is m s jain industries \\nthis appears to be the position at least till 30th may1986 in \\nthe meantime as a result of the ex parte ad interim injunction granted on 19th december 1985 by this court in suit no 2408 of 1985there was no question of thukral using the trademark field marshal till the injunction was vacated on 19th january1988 \\nthe act was enacted to provide for the registration and better protection of trademarks and for the prevention of the use of fraudulent marks of merchandise \\nregistration of a trade mark remains valid for seven years \\nrenewal applications are required to be filed on the expiry of seven years \\nm s jain industries got itself registered and obtained periodical renewal thereof as is required under the act \\nfirst respondent withdrew the application against m s jain industries \\nthe prayer in the application was to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps goods so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned \\nit is in the aforementioned situation we are called upon to determine the meaning of the words for the time being occurring in s 461b of the act \\ntwo interpretations thereto which are possible are 1 the said words would denote non use of the trade mark in relation to the goods by the appellant for a period of five years or longer and 2 the mark had not been used for a period of five years or longer either by the present proprietor thereof or his predecessor \\nwe may however also notice that another construction of the said provision has been put forth by mr sunderam learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that the word proprietor would not mean a registered proprietor but also a person who has become proprietor by long use thereof \\nthe words for the time being would mean differently in different situations \\nit may mean the moment or existing position as was held by this court in the case of jivendra nath kaul v collector district magistrate and anr 1992 \\n3 scc 576 1992 indlaw sc 1107 or in the context of cl 22 of art 366 of the constitution as has been held in h h maharajadhiraja \\nmadhav rao jivaji rao scindia bahadur of gwalior h h maharajadhiraja \\nmaharana shri bhagwat singhji bahadur of udaipur v union of india and anr air 1971 \\nsc 530 1970 indlaw sc 300 para 88 to mean by the use of the expression for the time being in cl 22 of art 366 \\nthe president is not invested with authority to accord a temporary recognition to a ruler nor with authority to recognize or not to recognize a ruler arbitrarily the expression for them time being predicts that there shall be a ruler of the indian state that if the first recognized ruler dies or ceases to be a ruler a successor shall be appointed and that there shall not be more rulers than one at a given time \\nthe terms also may bring within its umbrage the entire period of five years or more irrespective of the fact as to whether the registered proprietor was one or more than one as has been held by the high court \\nthere can not be any doubt or dispute that the registration of a trade mark confers a very valuable right \\nthe person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods as that of the registered owner \\nit confers an exclusive right of use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in which the trade mark is registered \\nthe same is an assignable right in terms of s 36 of the act whereas an unregistered trade mark is not \\nuser of the said mark therefore entails the consequences laid down under cl b of sub s 1 of s 46 \\nhowever such an application can be filed only by a person aggrieved \\nwhen the applicant before the board establishes the fact in regard to non user of the mark for a period of more than five years on the part of the registered owner the latter may show that his case falls within the purview of sub s 3 of s 46 \\nthe question which therefore arises is as to who can prove that he had the bona fide intention to use the trade mark on the date of application for registration \\nindisputably it would be the registered proprietor \\ns 46 is a penal provision \\nit provides for civil or evil consequences \\nit takes away the valuable right of a registered proprietor \\nit therefore can be taken away only when the conditions laid down therefor are satisfied \\nwhile we say so we are not oblivious of the fact that trafficking in trade mark is to be discouraged \\na registered proprietor of a trade mark should not be permitted to circumvent the law of user of the trade mark for a long time by assigning the same from time to time \\nbut then such a case has to be made out \\nallegation of trafficking is a serious one \\nit must be proved in presence of the person against whom such allegations are made \\nat the time of grant of original registration advertisements are issued and objections are called for \\nrenewal of registration in a sense also is not automatic \\na person who had been using the said trade mark as a proprietor thereof by user is supposed to keep itself abreast with such applications filed by another either for registration of the trade mark or renewal thereof \\nthe non user for a long time would disentitle a registered proprietor from renewal of the registration \\nit must not however be forgotten that s 461b provides for a special remedy \\nas a person obtains a right on and from the date of registration andor renewal thereof he can ordinarily be deprived of his right unless it is shown that the assignment thereof by his holder was not a bona fide one or had been made by way of camouflage \\nif the assignee has obtained assignment for bona fide use he may not be fastened with any liability owing to non user on the part of his predecessor \\nin other words the mistake of the predecessor should not be visited with non use of the present registered owner \\nit must however be observed that whether a use is for bona fide purpose would essentially be a question of fact \\nwhether s 461b read with s 48 of the act would bring within its purview not only a registered proprietor but also the proprietor who had otherwise acquired a right would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case \\nin kabushiki kaisha toshiba v tosiba appliances co ors 2008 8 scale 354 2008 indlaw sc 1395this court held we do not find any force in the aforementioned submission \\ncls a and b operate in different fileds \\nsub s 3 covers a case falling within cl b and not the cl a thereof \\nhad the intention of the parliament been that sub s 3 covers cases falling under cl b and clause ahaving regard to the similarity of the expressions used there was no reason as to why it could not be stated so explicitly \\nit was furthermore opined there may be a case where owing to certain special circumstances a continuous use is not possible \\nthe trade mark for which registration is obtained is used intermittently \\nsuch non user for a temporary period may be due to any exigency including a bar under a statute or a policy decision of the government or any action taken against the registrant \\nit was observed that in cases of intermittent use also cl b shall apply \\nin kabushiki kaisha toshiba this court relied upon hardie trading ltd anr \\nv addisons paint chemicals ltd 2003 11 scc 92 2003 indlaw sc 756 in our opinion the phrase person aggrieved for the purposes of removal on the ground of non use under s 46 has a different connotation from the phrase used in s 56 for canceling or expunging or varying an entry wrongly made or remaining in the register \\nthe submission of mr sudhir chandra \\nthat the appellant was an infringer both of the right of m s jain industries as also the first respondent and thus its use was not bona fide in a case of this nature can not be accepted \\nif appellant infringed the right of m s jain industries it was for it to take action there for \\nit did not \\nfirst respondent itself accepts that at least immediately prior to the institution of the suit appellant had been using the same \\nwe are not concerned herein as to since when it had been doing so \\nit obtained an or of injunction \\nthe order of injunction was vacated \\nfor one reason or the other the said order attained finality \\nprima facie therefore appellant has been held to be the registered owner of the trade mark \\nit is one thing to say that for the purpose of frustrating an application for rectification the appellant had colluded with its predecessor for the purpose of trafficking by entering into the deed of assignment which is otherwise illegal and bad in law \\nbut it is another thing to say that the appellant could be proceeded against alone for non user of the registered trade mark for a period of more than five years \\nfor the purpose of making out such a case both the original registrants as also the assignee were required to be impleaded as parties \\nwe may at this stage notice that in law of trade marks by mr k c kailasam while commenting on s 47 of the trade marks act1999 to which our attention has been drawn by mr sudhir chandra it is stated \\nnotes on clauses \\nthis clause corresponds to s 46 of the existing act and provides for removal of a trade mark from the register on the ground of non use \\na trade mark which is not used within five years of its registration becomes liable for removal either completely or in respect of those goods or services for which the mark has not been used \\nunder s 461it is proposed to clarify that the five years period will start from the date on which the trade mark is actually entered on the register \\nthis amendment is intended to remove any ambiguity as for all other purposes the date of registration will be the date on which the application was filed vide cl 232 proviso to sub cl 1 also provides that the tribunal may refuse removal of the mark if it is shown that any proprietor had in fact made bona fide use of the trademark for goods or services of the same description or associated goods or services \\nit is also proposed to increase the period from 1 to 3 months in cl 471a and b in which use of the trade mark prior to the date of filing of the application for removal of the trade mark shall be disregarded \\nthis is intended to prevent the registered proprietor to by pass the act by such token use after he comes to know that an application for removal is about to be filed sub cl 3 protects a mark from being removed from the register on ground of non use if such non use is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade \\nthe clause is proposed to be modified to clarify that special circumstances in the trade will include restrictions imposed by any law or regulation on the use of trade mark in india \\nconsequential amendments have been made to cover services cl 47 of the bill \\nthe court while construing a statute takes into consideration the parliamentary intent in amending the provisions thereof \\nit seeks to enhance the period of moratorium of use of the registered trade mark from one month to three months so as to prevent speculative assignment \\nthus a case of speculative assignment is specifically required to be made out \\nsuch an application may be maintainable in terms of s 56 of the act but strictly not in terms of s 461b thereof and that too in the absence of the original registered proprietor \\nwe are not satisfied with the explanation offered by the first respondent that it gave up the case of non use of the registered trade mark against m s jain industries on the basis of statement made by the learned counsel for the appellant firstly because consent does not confer jurisdiction secondly because want andor lack of jurisdiction on the part of the tribunal can not be waived as if any order is passed without jurisdiction the same would be a nullity and thirdly because the cause of action even according to the first respondent in his application before the high court was different \\nthe counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant did not state that it had waived its right so far as non impleadment of m s jain industries was concerned \\nit only consented for grant of liberty in favour of the first respondent for filing of an application for the self same cause of action \\nthe question of maintainability of the second suit is absence of the registrant proprietor was not and could not have been the subject matter of consent at that stage \\nthe cause of action which permitted the first respondent to file an application for rectification against m s jain industries was non user thereof by it \\nits non user and rectification of the register could not in the aforementioned situation have been tagged with the cause of action if any against the appellant \\nthe second contention of mr that the appellant was an infringer of the trade mark is again a question of fact \\nthe right of the first respondent as a proprietor of the trade mark by reason of a long user is required to be determined vis  vis m s jain industries as also the appellant in the suit filed by it which is pending \\nthe board could not while exercising its jurisdiction under s 461bof the act proceeded on the basis of such presumption \\nit is not correct that no cause of action survived against jain industries \\nit was not lost by reason of assignment as was contended by the learned counsel \\nin the suit only the competing right of the first respondent qua the appellant can be determined and not a right against m s such a right can not be determined in a proceeding under s 461b of the act which is restricted to non user of the registered trade mark \\nboth the appellant and the respondent no 1 were the infringers of the right of m s jain industries as it was the registered proprietor of the trade mark in respect of the goods in question namely centrifugal pumps \\ntwo interpretations of the said provision s 461b are possible \\nwhile interpreting the same however certain basic principles of construction of statute must be kept in mind \\nas it takes away somebody  s right it deserves strict construction \\njurisdiction of the board being dependent on determination of the foundational facts the same was required to be established on the basis of the averments made in the application and not otherwise \\nthe right of a registered trade mark is not lost automatically on the expiry of five years and one month \\nit does not provide for a sun set law \\nit has to be adjudicated upon \\nwhether the registered proprietor of the trade mark had taken recourse to trafficking or not must be determined in an appropriate proceeding \\nthe principle of purchaser of a property has a duty to make enquiriestherefore cannot apply in a case of this nature \\nso long as the right to assign a registered trade mark remains valid once the same is validly assigned the assignee derives the same right as that of the assignor in terms of the statute \\na title to a trade mark derived on assignment as provided for under the act can not be equated with a defective title acquired in any other property as admittedly on the date of assignment the right of the registered trade mark was not extinguished \\nboth the findings of the high court which we have noticed hereinbefore are findings on question of law and in that view of the matter the contention of mr sudhir chandra that the merit of the matter is yet to be gone into by the board can not be a ground for ignoring the submissions made at the bar \\nour attention has again been drawn to a passage from law of trade marks geographical indications by shri k c kailasam wherein the judgment of the tribunal has been criticized in the following terms from the above legislative intent it would seem that the period of non use of the trade mark is to be reckoned continuously from the date of its registration \\nin the case of american home products corporation v mac laboratories pvt ltd \\nrendered under the 1958 act it was held by the supreme court that the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the register has only to prove \\nsuch continuous non user \\nit would appear that neither the u k act nor the indian act at any time envisaged that the commencement of 5 year period of non use is to be delinked from the date of registration of the mark so as to give a fresh lease of life to the registration every time there is change in the ownership of the mark \\nif that be so any registered proprietor could easily defeat an application for rectification by assigning the mark to some other person to have a fresh period of 5 years from the date of assignment and thus effectively frustrate the very object of the provision in s 471a and b further it is to be noted that an assignment is subject to the provisions of the act and any rights vested in any other person see \\ns 37 the assignor can not obviously transfer more rights than he himself has to the assignee under the act \\nwe do not think that the approach of the learned author is entirely correct \\nan assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses \\nif his title is not extinguished by reason of a provision of a statute for non user of the trade mark for a period of five years any assignment made shall be valid subject to such situation which we have noticed in paragraph 25 supra \\nfor the views we have taken we are of the opinion that the impugned judgment can not be sustained \\nit is set aside accordingly \\nthe board shall however proceed to determine afresh the application filed by the first in the light of the legal principles explained above \\nthe appeal is allowed with costs \\ncounsel  s fee assessed at rs 100000 \\nappeal allowed \\n\",\n          \"this appeal by special leave has been preferred by tata consultancy engineers against an award dated 20th december1978 of the industrial tribunal maharashtra bombay revising the wage scales of certain categories of employees and granting various other benefits \\ntata consultant engineers at its inception was a partnership firm but subsequently the partnership was dissolved and in 1974 the undertaking became one of the divisions of tata sons limited \\nit functions as a consulting organisation and a service industry and does not manufacture any product or carry on trade \\nits work force consists of engineers and supervisors and different categories of workmen \\nout of 665 employees at bombay the draftsmen and the administrative staff number 306 these workmen are members of the tata consultant employees union \\nthey served a charter of demands in july1974on the appellant and as their demands were not accepted and conciliation proceedings proved fruitless the state government made a reference of the dispute under s 101 dindustrial tribunal maharashtra for adjudication \\nthe reference was numbered i t no 292 of 1975 \\nthe union filed a statement before the tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments \\nit was urged that the efficiency bar as a feature of the wage scales should be removed \\nthe dearness allowance it was claimed should be granted on a slab system \\nthe claim of the union was resisted by the appellant who maintained that the existing wage scales were fair and reasonable on a region cum industry basis and that it would not be possible for the appellant to bear the additional financial burden if the demands of the union were accepted \\nreference was made to the political uncertainty in iran which had placed an appreciable part of the appellant  s business in jeopardy and to various other factors peculiar to an engineering consultancy business beyond the appellant  s control \\nthere was fierce competition also it was asserted from other similar organisations \\nthe appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised \\nthere was no separate dearness allowance until january1977 when it was introduced for the first time \\nhouse rent allowance was also paid \\ndearness allowance became payable at 10 of the basic wage subject to a minimum of rs 50 and house rent allowance at 30 of the basic salary \\nnothing those facts the tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years there was definite need for revising the wage scales \\nit was pointed out that the dearness allowance and house rent allowance granted by the appellant made little impact in neutralising the cost of living \\nthe need for revising the wage scales was not disputed by the appellant \\nin proceeding to revise the wage structure the tribunal took into account the two principles involved in the process the financial capacity of the industry to bear the burden of an increased wage bill and the prevailing wage structure on an industry cum region basis \\nwage scale statements were filed by the parties before the tribunal pertaining to several engineering consultancy organisations but \\nin the absence of pertinent information concerning the strength of their labour force the extent of their business the financial position for some years the capital invested the precise nature of the business the position regarding reserves dividends declared and future prospects of the company the tribunal found that it was unable to rely on them as comparable concerns \\nholding it impossible in the circumstances to apply the principle of industry cum region basis the tribunal turned to a consideration of the financial capacity of the company to bear an additional burden in this connection it proceeded on the footing that the appellant was a separate and independent division of tata sons limited and had no functional integrality with the other divisions \\nhaving regard to the net profits earned by the appellant from 1968 to 1977 it found that the acceptance of the demands of the union would result in an increased burden of rs 7 crores a burden which would dry up the appellant  s resources and would be impossible for it to bear \\nthe union modified its demands but even the modified terms according to the tribunal appeared to be on the high side inasmuch as the resulting total burden of rs 1 70 crores was much higher than the average profits could sustain \\nthe particular character of the appellant that it was a service industry and not a manufacturing concern was taken into account and it was observed that unlike a manufacturing business there was little scope for diversification in the case of an engineering consultancy \\nnonetheless the tribunal observed there was every reason to expect that the appellant would be able to earn sound profits in the future and the instability in its business activities occasioned by the turbulent political situation in iran would be it was expected compensated by contracts secured in different developing countries \\nfor the purpose of determining the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal followed unichem laboratories v their workmen 1972 indlaw sc 181 where it was held that the gross profits should be computed without making deductions on account of taxation development rebate and depreciation \\nit decided also that there was no ground for deducting the notional value of gratuity \\nrevising the figures on that basis it computed the annual gross profits for the years 1968 to 1977 and determined the annual average at rs 26 69 lakhs \\nthe tribunal took note of the elaborate scales of wages already existing in the wage structure of the appellant and decided to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category \\nit also observed that the category of draughtsmen needed a special increase \\nbut it rejected the demand of the union for dearness allowance on the basis of a slab system because that would have imposed an unacceptable burden on the appellant  s financial capacity and there was no reason why the existing scheme of dearness allowance should be disturbed when a substantial increase was being made in the level of the basic wage \\ntaking into account the circumstance that besides the staff of 306 workmen represented by the union there were several other employees who would also have to be paid the tribunal considered it fair in paragraph 23 of the award to give a flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories \\nit rejected the demand of the union for abolishing the efficiency bar but the span of 15 years for earning increment was expanded in some grades to 20 years and some adjustments were also made in specific grades \\nthe tribunal also noted that after the salaries of the employees had been fixed in the respective scales senior employees would have to be given some more increments in the new scales according to their completed years of service \\ntaking all these factors into consideration it made an award dated 20th december1978 prescribing the following revision in the existing scales of wages \\nthe tribunal maintained the existing schemes of dearness allowance and house rent allowance and observed that in view of the revised basic wages there would be a resultant increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance \\nthe revised wage scales the tribunal directed should take effect retrospectively from 1st january1976 it also laid down the principle enabling the actual fitment of the workmen in their respective wage scales as on that date and also provided for the number of increments to which they would be entitled having regard to the period of completed service \\ntwo days after the award was made an application was made by the union stating in the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance \\nfurther it appears that the tribunal intended to grant the increase of rs 150 to each draughtsman and rs 100 to all other workmen in their basic pay \\nhowever this is not clearly mentioned anywhere in the award due to accidental slip or omission \\nthe union prayed that the position may be clarified and the award corrected accordingly \\non the same date the tribunal disposed of the application by the following order there can be no doubt that a flat increase of rs 150 to each of the employees in the category of draftsmen and of rs 100 to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award \\nthe same has been made clear in paragraph \\nno 23but it appears that the words to each employee after the figure rs 150 were omitted \\nsimilarly the same words to each employee after the figure 100 were omitted \\nwhen the award is sent for publication a necessary corrigendum be made in the award and the aforesaid words after the figures rs 150 and rs 100 be added \\nit may be mentioned that only from that point of view viz to grant flat increase of rs 150 and of rs 100 to the employees in the category of draftsmen and the other categories respectively that a burden statement was called for from the company and the same was submitted vide exhibit c 51 the fitment has also to be done only after the flat increase is added to the present basic salary of each employee \\ni do not think that any problem would arise for interpretation of the award \\nsince the award has been already signed i do not think anything further can be added to this award \\nsd k n wani industrial tribunal \\nin this appeal the learned counsel for the appellant had covered a wide field but in the end he states that the appellant is aggrieved by two matters only \\none is the retrospectivity attached to the revised wage scales and the other is the flat increase given to each employee of rs 150 in the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in other categories resulting from the order dated 22nd december1978 \\nthe workmen have filed an appeal by special leave civil appeal no 2300 of 1979in which they have challenged the rejection by the tribunal of their claim in respect of dearness allowance which they contend should be pegged to the cost of living index and should not be a fixed amount \\nconsidering the appeal of tata consulting engineers first the contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal erred in making the wage scales retrospective and in any event in ranging the retrospectivity back to 1st january1976 \\nwe have been taken through some of the material on the record in the attempt to support the contention but after giving careful thought to the matter i think there is ample justification for what the tribunal did \\nit must be remembered that although the wage scales were introduced as long ago as 1973 they were maintained at that level except for a slight revision some time thereafter \\nno dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time \\nthe cost of living had gone on increasing from 1972 onwards and as the tribunal has found the dearness allowance and house rent allowance made no appreciable impact in neutralising the increasing cost \\nduring all these years the appellant had continued to enjoy increasing profits nonetheless the emoluments received by the workmen did not receive the impress of the appellant  s growing prosperity \\nthe charter of demands was presented by the union in july1974 and when conciliation proceedings failed the state government made the reference to the industrial tribunal in 1975 the tribunal has referred to various considerations which prevailed with it in giving retrospectivity to the revised pay scales \\nthey are considerations which can not be ignored \\naccordingly the contention raised on behalf of the appellant against retrospectivity of the wage scales must be rejected \\nthe challenge embodied in the second contention against the amendment of the award is more serious \\nit is urged that the amendment results in the inclusion of a flat increase of rs 150 to each workman in the case of draughtsman and rs 100 to each workman in the case of other categories a result wholly unwarranted it is said by the intent of the original award and therefore falling beyond the jurisdiction of the tribunal \\nin making the application of 22nd \\ndecember1978the union invoked the jurisdiction of the \\ntribunal under rule 31 of the industrial disputes bombay rules1957 rule 31 provides the labour court tribunal or arbitrator may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any award it or he issues \\nthe jurisdiction given to the tribunal by rule 31 is closely circumscribed \\nit is only a clerical mistake or error which can be corrected and the clerical mistake or error must arise from an accidental slip or omission in the award \\nan accidental slip or omission implies that something was intended and contrary to that intention what should not have been included has been included or what should have been included has been omitted \\nit must be a mistake or error amenable to clerical correction only \\nit must not be a mistake or error which calls for rectification by modification of the conscious adjudication on the issues involved \\nis the instant case one where the amendment made by the tribunal in the original award can be said to correct a mere clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission \\nto answer the question it is necessary to examine the basis of the award and the intent which flows from that basis \\nthe terms of reference in the state government  s order required the tribunal to revise the scales of pay and dearness allowance and there was no mention of giving any ad hoc increase in the basic pay of individual workman \\nit would do well to recall that the claim of the union filed before the tribunal also centered on the need to revise the wage scales \\nthat was the main issue between the parties \\nit is to the task of revising the pay scales that the tribunal addressed itself and throughout the material part of the award it is that task which held its focussed attention \\nthe financial capacity of the appellant and the related study of its annual profits from 1968 to 1977were examined from that view point \\nthe sufficiency of the existing pay scales was considered in detail and regard was had to their original structure and the accretions made subsequently by way of dearness allowance and house rent allowance \\nfor the purpose of restructuring the pay scales the tribunal ruled on the paying capacity of the appellant both with reference to the profits of the preceding year as well as the prospects of the future \\nthe financial capacity as the tribunal observed constituted one of the principles which are required to be followed in the fixation of the wage structure \\na clear statement of its intention is found in paragraph 22 of the award where the tribunal stated i only propose to modify the existing structures of the scales with flat increases in each category \\nno ad hoc increase to the pay of each individual workman was intended \\nand that is confirmed by what was stated in paragraph 23 of the award considering this outgoing the flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draughtsman and rs 100 in the case of the other categories would be fair \\nit will be noted that the pay scales of different categories were being restructured and the flat increase envisaged there related to an increase in the general pay scales of different categories \\nindividual workmen were not present to the mind of the tribunal \\nthat the increase was pertinent to the general pay scales in the revised wage structure is patently clear from a comparison of the existing pay scales and the revised pay scales \\nthe comparative table of existing pay scales and the revised pay scales has been reproduced earlier \\nthe revised pay scales of all categories except the category of draughtsmen shows an increase of rs 100 in the initial pay fixed in each scale the increase in the case of the category of draughtsmen being rs 150  there was only one increase contemplated in the award in paragraph 23 of award and it is more than plain that the increase was the one incorporated in the revised pay scales pertaining to different categories \\nno second flat increase was envisaged at all \\nthe amendment made by the tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase this time to each individual workmen \\nif as the tribunal has stated in the amendment order the increase in paragraph 23 was intended to apply to each individual workmen there is nothing in the body of the award to form the foundation on which the actual figures in the restructured pay scales can be made to rest \\nthere will be no explanation why the initial start of the revised pay scales has been increased by rs 150 in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories \\nconsidering the fitment of the workman in the revised scales it was stated in the award that a workman found drawing a salary less than the beginning of the grade would be stepped up to the beginning of the grade and if his pay fell between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay was to be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale \\nconspicuous by its absence is any reference to a flat increase in the pay of an individual workmen \\neven when considering the range of permissible retrospectivity the tribunal stated in the award in view of the revision of the wage scales there would be consequent increase in the dearness allowance and the house rent allowance \\nand the clinching circumstances of all is that the award was made on the basis that the overall financial load according to paragraph 33 of the award would be to the tune of about rs 5 lakhs \\nit was that figure which the tribunal had in mind against the backdrop of the gross annual figures when it made the revised pay scales retrospective from 1st \\njanuary1976 this liability taken with the liability accruing on the need to increase the salaries of the other staff determined the tribunal  s deliberations in regard to the several features of the award including the grant of increments related to completed periods of service the expansion of the span from 15 years to 20 years for earning increments and other benefits \\nit can not be the case of the union that the figure of rs 5 lakhs mentioned in paragraph 33 of the award represented the result of adding a flat increase to the pay of each workman in addition to the benefits conferred by the revised pay scales and other awarded reliefs \\nin its order of 22nd \\ndecember1978the tribunal has referred to the statement exhibit c 51 filed by the appellant when called upon to indicate the increased financial burden apprehended by it \\nthe tribunal has relied on this statement as evidence showing that the appellant knew that a flat increase of rs 150 and rs 100 was intended to each of the employees in the category of draughtsmen and the other categories \\nin so construing the statement exhibit c 51the tribunal has grievously erred \\nit seems from a perusal of the document exhibit c 51that it is a statement giving trial figures of the increased financial load on different bases \\non the basis that a sum of rs 150 per month was added to the pay of each draughtsman and a sum of rs 100 was added to the pay of every other workman who belonged to the union staff the financial load would increase to rs 922032  likewise if a flat increase of rs 100 was given to individual workmen of all categories including draughtsmen the increased financial load would total rs 764256  the statement then goes on to indicate that if a flat increase of rs 75 per month were given to individual workmen of all categories the total increase would be rs 578220  again if the flat increase is rs 65 per month to the individual workmen of all categories the additional load would total rs 497772  finally on the basis that the individual draughtsman would be given an increase of rs 75 per month and the individual workmen of other categories rs 50 per month the additional load was calculated at rs 463092  it will be noted that the statement exhibit c 51was prepared on the basis of the employees strength as in december1971 a similar statement was prepared on the basis of the employees strength as in september1978 these statements can not be regarded as evidence that the appellant was cognizant of the intention of the tribunal to provide a flat increase to the pay of each workman \\nthe statement afforded an indication merely of what the additional financial load would be if a flat increase was given to the individual workman on the alternative basis set forth therein \\nnone of the alternatives was actually adopted by the tribunal because when the award was made the tribunal proceeded instead to restructure the wage scales by the addition of rs 150 in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories to the initial pay in the wage scales pertaining to those categories \\nthe addition was integrated as a feature of the wage scales it was not regarded as an addition to the pay of each individual workman \\nit seems that the tribunal was betrayed by a curious confusion in accepting the plea of the union that a flat increase to the pay of each workman was intended in the original wage and consequently it fell into the error of amending the award \\nthe evidence contained in the award throughout provides incontrovertible proof that this flat increase was never originally intended in the award \\nthe amendment has resulted in the tribunal making as it were a supplementary award whereby a further relief is being granted beyond that granted in the original award \\nthe original award was completed and signed by the tribunal and it can not be reopened now except for the limited purpose of rule 31 in travelling outside and beyond the terms of the original award the tribunal has committed a jurisdictional error \\nour attention has been drawn to what purports to be an endorsement by counsel for the appellant on the application dated 22nd december1978 filed by the union before the tribunal to the effect that the appellant would submit to whatever the tribunal decided and it is urged that the appellant is bound by the order made on the application \\nit is an accepted principle that consent by a party can not confer jurisdiction on a court \\nwhat is without jurisdiction will remain so \\nin the circumstances the order of 22nd december1978 is invalid so far as it amends paragraph 23 of the original award \\nthe corrigendum amending the award in consequence is liable to be quashed \\nthe second contention of the appellant is entitled to succeed \\ni shall now consider civil appeal no 2300 of 1979 filed by the workmen \\nthe only contention of the workmen is that the tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index \\nit is wrong in principle it is said to provide a fixed dearness allowance \\nreliance was placed on the hindustan times ltd new delhi v their workmen 1964 1 scr 234 1962 indlaw sc 436247 where it was observed by this court that dearness allowance should not remain fixed at any figure but should be on a sliding scale in order to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living \\nreference was also made to bengal chemical pharmaceutical works limited v its workmen \\n2 scr 113 1968 indlaw sc 183 now it is not a universal rule that the dearness allowance should in all cases be correlated with the cost of living index \\nthe tribunal in the present case considered the matter and found it sufficient and in accord with justice that the wage scales should be restructured with suitable increments provided therein \\nit noted that dearness allowance was being granted by the appellant at 10 of the salary subject to a minimum of rs 50 and house rent allowance at 30 of the basic salary \\nhaving regard to the not inconsiderable improvement in the level of the basic wage it observed that there would be a consequent increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance \\nin view of the increase so secured the tribunal rejected the suggestion that a slab system should be introduced in the dearness allowance or that there should be any other modification of the principle on which dearness allowance was being presently granted \\nit declared that the cumulative effect of an improved wage structure together with dearness allowance operating on a slab system would throw an impossible burden of about rs 1 crore on the financial capacity of the appellant \\nit was open to the tribunal to adopt the position which it did \\nif the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered \\nthe award is a composite document in which the several elements of increased wage scales larger increments longer span of 20 years for earning increments dearness allowance at 10 of the basic wage besides several other benefits have been integrated into a balanced arrangement in keeping with what the tribunal has found to be the financial capacity of the appellant \\nit is not possible to maintain one part of the award and supersede another \\naccordingly the appeal filed by the workmen must fail \\nin the result civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 is allowed in part insofar that the order dated 22nd december1978 of the industrial tribunal maharashtra bombay is quashed to the extent that it modifies the original award dated 20th december1978and the corrigendum made consequent thereto is also quashed \\ncivil appeal no 2300 of 1979 is dismissed \\nthere is no order as to costs \\nchinnappa reddy j we have had the advantage of perusing the judgment prepared by our learned brother pathak j we agree with him that civil appeal no 2300 of 1979 should be dismissed \\nwe also agree with him that civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 should also be dismissed in so far as it relates to the award dated december 201978 however we do not agree with our learned brother that civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 should be allowed in so far as it relates to the order dated december 221978 of the industrial tribunal which purports to correct the award dated december 201978 in our opinion civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 should be dismissed in its entirety \\nwe do not propose to give our reasons to the extent we are in agreement with pathak j and we propose to state our reasons for the disagreement only \\nit is needless to recapitulate all the basic facts which have been set out in the judgment of pathak j the award of the industrial tribunal was made on december 201978 on december 221978 that is to say two days after the award was made and when everything must have been fresh to the minds of the tribunal the respective parties and their advocates the employees union made an application under rule 31 of the industrial disputes bombay rules1957 seeking a correction of an error which it was claimed had crept into the award \\nthe application was as follows in the above reference your honour was pleased to pass an award on 20th december1978 \\nin the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance \\nfurther it appears that the tribunal intended to grant the increase of rs 150 to each draughtsman and rs 100 to all other workmen in their basic pay \\nthe union therefore prays the honourable tribunal to clarify the position and correct the award accordingly \\non this application the advocate for the employer company made the following endorsement submitted to whatever this honourable tribunal desires to do \\nthereafter the tribunal made an order on the same day in the following terms there can be no doubt that a flat increase of rs 150 to each of the employees in the category of draftsmen and of rs 100 to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award \\nthis order was made in the presence of shri manak gagrat advocate for the company and shri n p mehta advocate for the workmen \\nthe endorsement made on the application by the advocate for the company does not indicate that the company had any objection to the award being corrected as sought by the employees union \\non the other hand the endorsement reads as if there was tacit agreement on the part of the company to the correction sought by the union \\nthe order dated december 221978 of the tribunal also does not reveal that there was any opposition by the company to the application for correcting the award \\neven so we propose to examine whether the correction sought by the employees union was within the bounds of the authority of the tribunal or whether it was in effect a fresh award \\nthe primary and basic question considered by the industrial tribunal in making the award dated december 201978 was the question of revision of the wage scales \\nimplicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage scales and flat or ad hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary \\nit can not possibly be doubted that an industrial tribunal deciding upon the wage scales of the employees of an establishment would have full liberty to propose ad hoc increase of salaries as part of the revision of wages \\nnor can it be doubted that fitment into the revised pay scales is certainly a part of the revision of pay scales \\nthis in our opinion is elementary and fundamental to the jurisdiction of the industrial tribunal in revising wage scales \\nin the present case the industrial tribunal on a consideration of the material placed before it came to the conclusion that the company was in an undoubted position to bear the additional financial burden \\nat the end of paragraph 15 of the award the tribunal stated but there can be no doubt that the company can very well bear the additional burden \\nthe question is what should be the extent of such burden \\nat the end of paragraph 18 of the award the tribunal said a mere reading of exhibit u 15 will immediately dispel the misgivings about the future of the present company \\nfor some years to come this is likely to be one of the few consulting engineers who will be securing major contracts \\nagain in paragraph 19 it was said i have no doubt that the present company would be able to bear the additional burden for the years to come \\nthis is further borne out from the trading results of the company for the year 1968 69 to 1977 the profits have increased all along \\nthe copy of the letter dated july 231973alongwith \\nthe annexures from the company to the director general posts telegraphs delhi ex \\nc 27 indicates the important projects the company was handling in india and abroad and the amount of foreign exchange earned and repatriated \\ni will therefore proceed on the ground that the present company can bear the additional financial burden \\nfinally at the end of paragraph 21 \\nthe tribunal said in view of this position the company can easily bear some burden that might fall as a result of the upward revision of the wage scales \\nthe question is to what extent the relief should be given to the employees \\nafter expressing himself in categoric terms about the capacity of the company to bear the additional financial burden the tribunal went on to say i only propose to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category \\nthe tribunal then considered the question whether draftsmen should get a higher flat increase and the question whether the existing scheme of dearness allowance should be revised \\nthe tribunal then observed the flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draftsmen and rs 100 in the case of the other categories would be fair \\nthereafter various other matters were considered and finally the tribunal revised the wage scales in the manner already mentioned by my brother pathak j the question of fitment was then considered in the following manner fitment if as on 1st january1976an employee is drawing a salary less than the beginning of the respective grade he should be first stepped up to the beginning of the grade \\nif the pay of an employee does not coincide with any step in the revised pay scale and falls between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay of that employee shall be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale \\nafter fixing the salary of the employees in the scales as above the employees should be given increments in the new scales as noted below i employees who have completed 5 years or more as on 1st january19763 increments \\nii employees who have completed 4 years of service as on 1st january19762 increments \\nall other employees with more than one year  s service shall be given one increment \\nnow if without any flat or ad hoc increase of salary the workmen were to be fitted into the revised scales of pay it would obviously result in serious anomalous situations \\nin the case of several senior employees the revised scale would yield but a very small and almost a token increase in the size of the pay packet whereas the junior employees would get a large benefit \\nwhile workmen raising industrial disputes for revision of wage scales are certainly minded about their future prospects in the matter of wages they surely would be more concerned with the immediate benefits according to them \\nthat was why the industrial tribunal thought that an all round flat increase of rs 150 in the case of draftsmen and rs 100 in the case of other workmen was called for \\nit was clearly so intended by the tribunal as is evident from the reference to flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draftsmen and rs 100 in the case of the other categories \\nsince there was to be a flat increase of rs 150 and rs 100 in the case of draftsmen and other workmen respectively the revised wage scale had necessarily to commence with figures rs 150 and rs 100 above the existing wage scales \\nimmediately after the award was pronounced while the iron was still hot as it were the employees apparently realised that the employer might take advantage of the circumstance that it was not clearly mentioned in the award that all the employees were to get additional pay of rs 150 and rs 100 respectively and might contend that the tribunal had only revised the wage scales by increasing the salary on entry into the service and restructuring the scale of pay and never granted any ad hoc increase of salary to all employees \\ntherefore they filed an application before the tribunal for correcting the award so as to bring out what was intended \\nas it has now turned out what the employees apparently suspected the employer might contend is precisely what the employer is not contending though the employer did not choose to so contend before the industrial tribunal itself when the employees filed the application for rectification \\nthe application before the tribunal was filed under rule 31 of the bombay industrial disputes rules 1957which is as follows \\na board court labour court tribunal or arbitrator may at any time suo moto or on an application made by any of the parties concerned may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any proceedings report award or as the case may be decision \\nthe omission of the words to each employee first after the figure rs 150 and again after the figure rs 100 was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the tribunal was entitled to correct \\nwe are unable to see how it can be held to be otherwise \\nwe are not impressed with the submission of the learned counsel for the company that the corrigendum was in effect a fresh award \\nwe therefore see no ground for quashing the order dated december 221978 of the tribunal \\nthe result of the foregoing discussion is that civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 has to be dismissed in its entirety \\nwe have already indicated that we agree with our brother pathak j that the appeal civil appeal no 2300 of 1979 filed by the workmen should also be dismissed \\nwhile we find lot of force in the submission of shri v m tarkunde learned counsel for the workmen that dearness allowance linked to cost of living index is ordinarily the best and the most scientific method of computing dearness allowance it can not always be said that an illegality warranting interference under article 136 is committed if some other method is adopted \\nthe tribunal has given satisfactory reason for adopting a different mode and we are not disposed to interfere with the award of the tribunal \\nin the result both the appeals are dismissed without any order as to costs \\nthe order of the court was as follows \\nin view of the opinion of the majority both the appeals are dismissed and there is no order as to costs \\n\",\n          \"ujjagar singh the appellant herein a resident of village bangawali tehsil malerkotla was tried and convicted by the additional sessions judge sangrur for the murder of his niece mukhtiar kaur and was awarded the death penalty \\nin addition he was convicted for an offence punishable section 376 of the ipc and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to a fine of rs 5 000 and in default of payment to undergo further r i for one year and section 309 of the ipc to a sentence of simple imprisonment for one year \\nthe aforesaid convictions and sentences have been maintained by the high court and the matter is before us in these proceedings by way of special leave \\nthe facts of the case are as under \\nat about 2 00 p m on 10th november 2002 a boy whose identity is not forthcoming informed satnam singh pw2 that an incident of firing had taken place in the house of ujjagar singh situated in the fields on the outskirts of the village \\nsatnam singh conveyed this information to sarpanch jora singh pw1 who was attending a marriage at that time \\njora singh accompanied by gurdeep singh pw3 thereupon rushed to ujjagar singh  s house and found mukhtiar kaur lying dead with a gun shot injury and the appellant also with a gun shot injury lying unconscious on the ground in the adjoining room \\njora singh and gurdeep singh immediately removed ujjagar singh to the civil hospital dhuri in the jeep belonging to kulwant singh pw4 \\njora singh also met inspector harjinder pal singh pw14 at 4 40 p m near the hospital who recorded his statement at that place and with his endorsement exhibit p a sent it to police station dhuri where the formal fir was registered at about 4 45 p m with the special report being delivered to the illaka magistrate at dhuri itself at 6 20 p m the same evening \\nthe facts as narrated were that arjan singh of village bangawali had three sons puran singh ujjagar singh appellant and ajmer singh \\npuran singh had died about 20 years earlier leaving behind his wife two sons and a daughter mukhtiar kaur \\nthe two sons and the wife also died long before the incident and mukhtiar kaur the sole surviving member of this branch of the family had been married to balwinder singh pw9 about 9 or 10 years earlier \\npuran singh had however transferred 30 or 35 bighas of agricultural land falling to his share after the death of his father in the name of the appellant  s sons by a collusive decree in the year 1994 and the suggestion was that this transaction had been objected to by mukhtiar kaur who was demanding that the land be returned to her \\nit appears that mukhtiar kaur  s relations with her in laws had got strained and she had left her matrimonial home and come to live with ujjagar singh her uncle 7 or 8 months earlier and the suggestion was that mukhtiar kaur had been killed by the appellant with his licensed gun and he had thereafter attempted to commit suicide \\nhaving recorded the aforesaid facts in the fir pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh reached the place of incident and lifted one spent 12 bore cartridge case shaktiman make from near mukhtiar kaur  s dead body and one dbbl gun from the place where ujjagar singh appeared to have been shot and another spent cartridge case was recovered from the right barrel of the gun \\nafter completion of the investigation at the spot mukhtiar kaur  s dead body was sent for its post mortem examination \\nthe post mortem examination was also conducted by pw5 dr ishwar singh medical officer civil hospital along with dr harwinder kaur pw17 and it was found that mukhtiar kaur had two gunshot injuries on her dead body a wound of entry on the back of right side of chest 2 cm x 1 cm with margining and blackening and a corresponding exit wound of 5 cm x 3 5 cm to the front of the right side of the chest \\ndr harwinder kaur aforesaid also took swabs from the vagina of the deceased and as per the chemical examiner  s report dated 2 1 2003 semen was found on the swab taken from the vagina and from the underwear that mukhtiar kaur had been wearing at the time of her death \\nthe weapon and the recovered cartridge cases had also been sent to the forensic science laboratory which in its report dated 4 8 2004 opined that the crime cartridge case ci could have been fired by the right barrel of the weapon whereas the crime cartridge case c2 had been fired from the right barrel \\non the completion of the investigation a charge sheet under sections 302 376 and 309 of the ipc was filed against the accused and as he pleaded not guilty he was brought to trial \\nduring the trial jora singh pw1 satnam singh pw2 gurdeep singh pw3 and kulwant singh pw4 resiled from their statements given to the police and were declared hostile \\nbalwinder singh pw9 however supported the prosecution case deposing that the land had in fact been got transferred from gurmail kaur mother of mukhtiar kaur to ujjagar singh by fraud and mukhtiar kaur was therefore entitled to its return \\nhe also deposed that mukhtiar kaur had told him some time earlier that the accused had been beating her and had also committed sexual intercourse with her and that at about 11 p m on 10 11 2002 karam singh pw10 had informed him as to what had transpired on which he along with his father hamir singh pw12 and several others had rushed to bangawali \\npw10 karam singh aforesaid confirmed the story given by balwinder singh \\nthe prosecution also relied on the statements of dr vijay kumar pw6 of the civil hospial dhuri who testified that the appellant had been brought to the hospital at about 2 45 p m on 10 11 2002 with a serious gun shot injury dr ripan miglani pw15 of the dayanand medical college hospital ludhiana who deposed that he had been admitted to the department of neuro surgery with a serious gun shot injury and dr sanjay uppal pw16 a plastic surgeon who disclosed that the appellant had been under his treatment for almost 5 weeks and the burnt area around the firearm injury had been removed by him \\nthe prosecution also placed reliance on the statement of asi jasbir singh pw11 who had accompanied inspector harjinder pal singh pw14 to the place of incident and supported the recoveries made from the spot \\nthe prosecution case was then put to the accused and his statement recorded section \\n313 of the cr \\np c in reply to question 33 he stated as under i am innocent \\ni have been implicated falsely in this case \\ni was treating mukhtiar kaur as my daughter and loved her as my daughter \\nfalse allegations have been levelled against me \\ni never harassed mukhtiar kaur nor ever got her land mutated from her mother by fraud \\ni have not killed mukhtiar kaur \\nmother of mukhtiar kaur got the land mutated by her own free will and mukhtiar kaur had no dispute about it \\nbalwinder singh her husband was addicted to vices and used to beat her due to which she used to remain under depression and sick generally and used to come to me as my daughter \\nmy house kothi is situated on the outer skirts of village bangawali and door planks had not been fixed so far to rooms \\nsome body suddenly came and fired at me \\ni fell down on the ground and became unconscious \\ntherefore i could not see what had happened to mukhtiar kaur as she was in other room \\nlater on i came to know that some body had fired at her and she died \\ni regained consciousness in hospital \\nthe story of rape by me with her has been fabricated by her husband as he is inimical towards me \\neven i do not know who took me to hospital \\ni have been implicated in this case falsely \\nthe trial court and the high court relying on the circumstances available on the evidence convicted and sentenced the appellant as already mentioned above \\nmr goburdhan the learned counsel for the accused has raised several arguments in the course of hearing \\nhe has pointed out that there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that mukhtiar kaur had been subjected to rape and in this view of the matter the very basis for the imposition of the death penalty was not made out \\nhe has also pointed out that there were no eye witnesses to the incident and the 4 witnesses i e jora singh and others who had reached the place of incident and carried the injured appellant to the hospital had also resiled and as the prosecution story now rested on circumstantial evidence alone it was imperative for the investigating officer to have taken the finger prints from the weapon and that in any case the recovery of the spent cartridges and the gun were clearly suspicious as the weapon had been sent to the laboratory after an inordinate delay \\nit has also been submitted that in a case of attempted suicide a firearm must of necessity be used from a very close range and the absence of any blackening charring or burning around the wound on ujjagar singh clearly ruled out the possibility of such an attempt \\nit has finally been submitted that the land had been transferred in the name of ujjagar singh  s sons in the year 1994 by gurmail kaur mother of mukhtiar kaur by a collusive decree and there was no evidence to show that mukhtiar kaur had ever displayed any unhappiness or made any complaint to any person or any authority with regard to the decree and as such the very basis of the prosecution story did not exist \\nthe learned state counsel has however supported the judgment of the courts below \\nhe has further emphasized that the prosecution  s case stood proved from various factors including the medical evidence the reports of the forensic science laboratory the chemical examiner from the post mortem reports and the recovery of the gun and cartridges \\nwe have heard the learned counsel for the parties and gone through the record \\nwe first take up for consideration the question of the conviction section 376 of the ipc \\nwe find from the medical evidence and from the chemical examiner  s reports that the vaginal swab and clothes taken from the dead body did indicate the presence of semen \\nthere is however absolutely no evidence to suggest even assuming that the intercourse had been committed by the appellant that he had done so without mukhtiar kaur  s consent or against her will \\nsome suspicions of rape could perhaps have been raised had some tell tale injuries been detected on mukhtiar kaur  s person but we find that the two injuries other than the gun shot wounds i e injury no 3 being on the left pinna and \\nno 4 an abrasion near the right eye do not indicate any attempt to rape or the commission of rape \\nit is also significant that the investigators had made no attempt whatsoever to have the appellant medically examined to ascertain his capacity to perform sexual intercourse \\nthe learned state counsel relying on the statement of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh has however submitted that the examination had not been possible as the appellant had received a very serious gun shot injury and was hanging between life and death \\nwe agree with the submission of the learned counsel that an examination could not have been carried out immediately \\nbut we see no justification in the omission of the prosecution to have him examined after he had recovered his health and been discharged from hospital \\nwe are further of the opinion that even assuming for a moment that sexual intercourse between the two had indeed taken place it can not be said from the evidence before us that it was without the consent or against the wishes of mukhtiar kaur \\nwe therefore find that ujjagar singh  s conviction section 376 of the ipc can not be sustained \\nmr goburdhan has placed great emphasis on the fact that as the four witnesses who had reached the place of incident i e jora singh satnam singh gurdeep singh and kulwant singh had resiled from their statements and had disowned their initial stories the prosecution had of necessity to rely on circumstantial evidence and if the chain of circumstances remained incomplete or even if one link in the chain was broken the prosecution must fail \\nhe has also relied on the judgment of balu sonba shinde v state of maharashtra 2002 7 scc 543 2002 indlaw sc 1923 to contend that it was open to the accused to take advantage insofar as possible from the statement of a witness though declared hostile and the four witnesses having disowned the prosecution story and having given a different version the appellant was entitled to derive such benefit as possible in this situation \\nthe learned state counsel has however emphasized that both the trial court and the high court had for good reasons opined that the circumstances made out a case for conviction and the accused having given a counter version some obligation lay on him as well to explain the circumstances against him inasmuch that admittedly he and the victim were alone in the house at the time of the incident \\nreliance for this argument has been placed on the decision of raj kumar prasad tamarkar v state of bihar anr 20071 \\nscale 19 2007 indlaw sc 5 \\nwe have considered their arguments very carefully \\nin mahmood v state of u p 1976 1 scc 542 1975 indlaw sc 643 it has been observed that in a case dependent wholly on circumstantial evidence the court must be satisfied athat the circumstances from which the inference of guilt is to be drawn have been fully established by unimpeachable evidence beyond a shadow of doubt bthat the circumstances are of a determinative tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused and cthat the circumstances taken collectively are incapable of explanation on any reasonable hypothesis save that of the guilt sought to be proved against him \\nin this case this court held that the omission of the prosecution inter alia to have the finger prints found on the alleged murder weapon was fatal to the prosecution story \\nin 1984 4 scc 116 sharad birdhichand sarda v state of maharashtra 1984 indlaw sc 432 this court discussed the ratio of the judgments in hanumant v state of m p air 1952 sc 343 1952 indlaw sc 89 tufail alias simmi v state of u p 1969 3 scc 198 1969 indlaw sc 573 and ramgopal v state of maharashtra 1972 4 scc 625 1971 indlaw sc 555 and shivaji sahabrao bobade v state of maharashtra 1973 2 scc 793 1973 indlaw sc 181 and observed thus a close analysis of this decision would show that the following conditions must be fulfilled before a case against an accused can be said to be fully established 1the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established \\nit may be noted here that this court indicated that the circumstances concerned must or should and not may be established \\nthere is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between may be proved and must be or should be proved as was held by this court in shivaji sahabrao bobade v state of maharashtra 1973 indlaw sc 181 where the following observations were made \\ncertainly it is a primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and the mental distance between may be is long and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions \\n2the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused that is to say they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty 3the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency 4they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved and 5there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused \\nmr goburdhan has also cited mahmood v state of u p 1976 1 scc 542 1975 indlaw sc 643 shankarlal gyarasilal dixit v state of maharashtra 1981 2 scc 35 1980 indlaw sc 47 sharad birdhichand sarda v state of maharashtra 1984 4 scc 116 1984 indlaw sc 432 omwati smt and

sc 144 in support of his plea relating to the evaluation of circumstantial evidence \\nthese judgments have broadly followed the principles laid down in the judgments referred to above and need not therefore be dealt with us in extenso \\nit must nonetheless be emphasized that whether a chain is complete or not would depend on the facts of each case emanating from the evidence and no universal yardstick should ever be attempted \\nit is in this background that we must examine the circumstances in the present case \\na few facts stand out from the prosecution story \\nfirst the place of incident being adjoining rooms in the residential house of the appellant and the fact that the alleged murder weapon is his licensed dbbl gun is proved on record \\nthe evidence also reveals that the appellant was living in the premises along with his wife mother and son and two daughters who were studying outside the village were frequent visitors but it is the admitted position that nobody but the appellant and the deceased were present at the time of incident \\nit is also clear from the evidence that the two spent cartridge cases recovered one from near mukhtiar kaur  s dead body and the second from the right barrel of the gun lying near the appellant had been sent to the forensic science laboratory which opined that one of the cartridges had been fired from the gun and the other could have been fired therefrom \\nmr goburdhan has however laid great emphasis on the fact that no reference to the gun or cartridges had been made in the inquest report and that in any case the weapon and the spent cartridges had been sent to the laboratory belatedly \\nwe are of the opinion however that no adverse inference can be drawn from either of these circumstances \\nthe aforesaid articles had been carried to the laboratory by constable gopal singh who in his affidavit dated 17th march 2003 deposed that he had first taken the articles to the laboratory on 9th december 2002 but they had been returned by the director on the ground that the seals affixed thereon were not of the requisite number and that after removing the objections raised by the director the articles aforesaid had been returned to the laboratory on 18th december 2002 \\ngopal singh was cross examined by the prosecution \\nand but for some inconsequential questions put to him with regard to the seals not even a suggestion was made that the aforesaid articles had in any way been tampered with \\nit is true as contended that in column 22 of the inquest report which refers to the articles found near the dead body there is no reference to the spent cartridges or the murder weapon but we find from a perusal of the site plan exh \\npjj prepared by the investigating officer inspector harjinder pal singh pw14 on 10th november 2002 that the weapon is shown lying close to the place where the appellant had been found unconscious and a spent cartridge recovered from near the dead body of mukhtiar kaur \\nit has also been submitted by mr goburdhan that there appeared to be no motive for the incident as the story about mukhtiar kaur  s unhappiness about the transfer of land to the sons of ujjagar singh sought to be proved by pw9 balwinder singh and pw10 karam singh had been disbelieved by the high court with the observation that the statements of these two witnesses could not be relied upon \\nit is true that in a case relating to circumstantial evidence motive does assume great importance but to say that the absence of motive would dislodge the entire prosecution story is perhaps giving this one factor an importance which is not due and to use the clichi \\nthe motive is in the mind of the accused and can seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy \\nthere is however a hint in the testimony of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh that his enquiries had revealed that the accused was having illicit relations with mukhtiar kaur and we can assume that some thing untoward had happened which could have triggered the volatile and hostile incident \\nthere could perhaps be some truth in this suggestion as it is significant that though the appellant had an extended family living with him i e mother wife son living in the village and two young daughters who were studying outside and residing in a hostel but were frequent visitors home yet none of them has come forth to depose in his favour \\nto our mind therefore this is yet another circumstance inculpating the accused \\nmr goburdhan has also laid much stress on the apparent discordance between the prosecution story and the medical evidence and has argued that had the accused attempted to commit suicide the gun shot must of necessity had to be fired from a very close range on which the wound would have marks of burning or charring and that in any event a full blooded shot from a very close range would have torn his face apart \\nhe has in this connection referred us to the statement of dr ripan miglani pw15 and the wound found on the appellant at the time of his medical examination in the department of surgery of the dayanand medical college hospital ludhiana which was about 15 x 8 cm curvilinear wound present on the left half of face extending upto bone \\nno blackening or foreign body was visible \\nunderlying muscles were exposed and contamination was present \\nhe has thus urged that the absence of any blackening underlined the argument that the shot had been fired from some distance and as such an attempt at suicide was clearly to be ruled out \\nhe has also drawn our attention to the cross examination of the doctor wherein he reiterated that there was no visible blackening and that it was not possible for him to say whether the injury was suicidal or otherwise \\nthe learned state counsel has however relied on the statement of pw16 dr sanjay uppal who was apparently the first doctor to have examined the appellant wherein he clearly testified that the blackened portion around the firearm injury had been removed by him \\nwe are therefore of the opinion that this statement falsifies mr goburdhan  s argument on this aspect \\nit is also significant that the shot had apparently travelled upwards skirting the mandible through the flesh of the cheek in an upward direction with minimal damage to the bone structure and it is indeed providential that the appellant got away with only an injury albeit a very serious one \\nthe fact that the shot was fired from below going upwards is also supported by the site plan exh \\npjj wherein marks of a shot hitting the roof were seen at point e whereas the appellant was found lying at point d in the same room \\nit is therefore apparent that the weapon had indeed been fired by the appellant from a close range and that the blackened portion around the wound had been removed by dr sanjay uppal \\nthe learned state counsel has emphasized that in the light of the admitted position that the accused and the deceased were the only ones present at the time of incident and that the accused had projected a counter story some credible explanation was also expected from him \\nreference has been made to raj kumar prasad tamarkar  s case2007 indlaw sc 5 supra wherein in circumstances surprisingly akin to the present matter this court had the following observations to make the conspectus of the events which had been noticed by the learned sessions judge as also by the high court categorically go to show that at the time when the occurrence took place the deceased and the respondent only were in the bedroom and the terrace connecting the same \\nthere was no other person \\nthe cause of death of the deceased usha devi i e by a gun shot injury is not disputed \\nthe fact that the terrace and the bedroom are adjoining each other is not in dispute \\nthe autopsy report shows that a blackening and charring existed so far as injury no i is concerned \\nthe blackening and charring keeping in view the nature of the firearm which is said to have been used clearly go to show that a shot was fired from a short distance \\nblackening or charring is possible when a shot is fired from a distance of about 2 feet to 3 feet \\nit therefore can not be a case where the death might have been caused by somebody by firing a shot at the deceased from a distance of more than 6 feet \\nthe place of injury is also important \\nthe lacerated wound was found over grabella middle of forehead \\nit goes a long way to show that the same must have been done by a person who wanted to kill the deceased from a short distance \\nthere was thus a remote possibility of causation of such type of injury by any other person who was not in the terrace \\nonce the prosecution has been able to show that at the relevant time the room and terrace were in exclusive occupation of the couple the burden of proof lay upon the respondent to show under what circumstances death was caused to his wife \\nthe onus was on him \\nhe failed to discharge the same \\nwe have considered the submission of the state counsel very carefully \\nit is true that it is generally for the prosecution to prove its case beyond doubt but in circumstances such as the present one some explanation is also due from an accused in order to absolve himself from suspicion of the crime \\nin his statement section p c his positive stand was that he alone had been in the house with mukhtiar kaur when she had been killed and indeed as per exhibit p jj mukhtiar kaur  s body had been found only one karam 5 feet away from the place where the appellant lay injured \\nit must be emphasized that but for this self serving statement made by the appellant there is nothing on record to support his positive stance \\neven otherwise we are of the opinion that had the shot been fired by some intruder the direction would have been more or less horizontal and parallel to the ground and not from down upwards with the pellets hitting the jaw skirting the cheek and hitting the roof at point \\ne in modi  s medical jurisprudence and toxicology 23rd edition at page 765 while dealing with identification of homicidal and suicidal injuries it has been observed that a suicidal firearm wound is usually a contact wound situated on the side of the temple depending on which hand was used to shoot himself in the centre of the forehead the roof of the mouth in the chest or epigastrium in front or the left side and some times under the chin \\nthe firearm is usually fired at close range \\na small weapon like a revolver or a pistol is held in the hand while a rifle or a shot gun is supported on the ground or against the wall \\nsometimes the firing is done by pulling a string tied to the trigger by the big toe \\nthe skin around the entry wound shows characteristic blackening scorching and tattooing \\nin such cases the hand used to steady the weapon at the muzzle may be blackened and scorched and may also be stained with squirting of the blood from the injured arteries \\nin homicidal and accidental shooting the wound may be on any part of the body and the path of the bullet may be in any direction \\nhomicidal shooting by dacoits is not uncommon in india and they are known to make their own firearms \\nimmediate death following a firearm wound is uncommon and even when vital organs are injured a person may be capable of doing extraordinary things \\nsometimes firearm wounds may look like knife slashes or a bullet hole may resemble a penetrating stab wound if the bullet strikes the head of shoulder at an angle or when an unstable bullet registers a broadside hit \\na fateh describes a rare homicidal gun shot wound of the mouth where the entry wound was in the tongue and the direction was horizontally backward while in suicidal wounds the direction is upwards entrance would be in the palate or posterior pharynx \\ndr b r sharma in his book forensic science in criminal investigation and trials fourth edition at page 1160 too has delineated the circumstances that could indicate suicide and while referring to the site of the injury has observed certain sites are predominantly used by suicides for self inflicted injuries \\nfor example with firearm temple forehead mouth and chest are the favourite sites \\nwith knife throat and wrist are the favourite sites \\nhesitation injuries are also observed in some suicide cases \\nit is therefore clear to us that the story of unknown assailants entering the house and causing mukhtiar kaur  s murder etcetera has to be ruled out and that the prosecution story that it was the appellant who had first shot mukhtiar kaur and then attempted to commit suicide stands proved \\nwe also find that no part of the evidence of the hostile witnesses comes to the aid of the appellant \\nthe question now arises as to the sentence that should be imposed on the appellant \\nit would be seen that both the sessions court and the high court were appalled by the allegations and findings of incestuous rape and murder \\nwe are however of the opinion as already noted above that a case of rape has not been made out \\nin this background the death sentence is not called for \\nwe accordingly acquit the appellant of the charge section 376 of the ipc but maintain his conviction for the other offences but commute his death sentence to life \\nwith this modification the appeal is dismissed \\nappeal dismissed \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"expected_output\",\n

and,thus,acquired a reputation in that behalf,a legal notice was issued upon it questioning its right to use the said mark in respect of centrifugal pumps by the appellant laying a claim that it had been using the said mark since 1963.\\nrespondent no.1 thereafter filed a suit in the delhi high court for grant of a decree of permanent injunction being suit no.2408 of 1985 alleging infringement of the said mark and/or claiming right of passing off in respect thereof.\\nan ex parte order of injunction was passed on 19.12.1985 against the defendant.\\nmeanwhile,a temporary ex parte injunction is issued against the defendants restraining them from manufacturing or selling either themselves or through any dealer or representative diesel oil engines or parts thereof with the trade mark 'field marshal' and/or any other trade mark identical therewith and all goods falling in cl.7 of the trade and merchandise mark rules.\\nthe second rectification application filed by the first respondent,however,was transferred to the intellectual property appellate board.\\nthe said application was dismissed.\\na writ petition was filed there against by the first respondent.\\na learned single judge of the delhi high court,however,refused to stay the operation of the order of the board dated 27.10.2004.an appeal was preferred there against.\\nthe division bench of the high court thereafter while disposing of both the writ petition and the letters patent appeal allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of the board and directed it to adjudicate the dispute on merits.\\nthe said order of the division bench is under challenge in this appeal.\\n\\nargument\\nappellant's counsel appeared on that date and,inter alia,contended that presently it was the registered owner of the trade mark which was sought to be cancelled.\\nin view of that statement,a submission was made on behalf of the first respondent that it may be permitted to withdraw the petition with liberty to file a fresh petition on the same cause of action.\\n\\nissue\\nwhether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case,the application under s.46(1)(b) was maintainable.\\nwhether  to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps (goods) so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned.\\n\\nanalysis\\nthe core question which arises for our consideration is as to whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case,the application under s.46(1)(b) was maintainable.\\nindisputably,the scope of the provisions for removal from register in terms of s.46 and 56 of the act stand on different footings.\\nwhereas s.46 had a limited application,s.56 of the act is wider in nature. concededly,cl.(a) of sub-s.(1) of s.46 is not attracted in the case.\\nthe prayer in the application was to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps (goods) so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned.\\nit is in the aforementioned situation,it is advisable to determine the meaning of the words 'for the time being' occurring in s.46(1)(b) of the act.\\ntwo interpretations thereto which are possible are: (1) the said words would denote non-use of the trade mark in relation to the goods by the appellant for a period of five years or longer; and (2) the mark had not been used for a period of five years or longer either by the present proprietor thereof or his predecessor.\\nthe words 'for the time being' would mean differently in different situations.\\nit may mean 'the moment or existing position' as was held by this court in the case of jivendra nath kaul v. collector/district magistrate and anr.[(1992. 3 scc 576 1992 indlaw sc 1107] or in the context of cl.(22) of art.366 of the constitution as has been held in h.h.maharajadhiraja. madhav rao jivaji rao scindia bahadur of gwalior,h.h.maharajadhiraja. maharana shri bhagwat singhji bahadur of udaipur v. union of india and anr.,air 1971. sc 530 1970 indlaw sc 300 para 88  to mean: \\\"by the use of the expression \\\"for the time being\\\" in cl.(22) of art.366. the president is not invested with authority to accord a temporary recognition to a ruler nor with authority to recognize or not to recognize a ruler arbitrarily : the expression \\\"for them time being\\\" predicts that there shall be a ruler of the indian state,that if the first recognized ruler dies,or ceases to be a ruler,a successor shall be appointed,and that there shall not be more rulers than one at a given time.\\nthe person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods as that of the registered owner.\\nit confers an exclusive right of use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in which the trade mark is registered.\\nwhether s.46(1)(b) read with s.48 of the act would bring within its purview,not only a registered proprietor but also the proprietor who had otherwise acquired a right would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\\nthe court while construing a statute takes into consideration the parliamentary intent in amending the provisions thereof. it seeks to enhance the period of moratorium of use of the registered trade mark from one month to three months so as to prevent speculative assignment.\\nthus,a case of speculative assignment is specifically required to be made out. such an application may be maintainable in terms of s.56 of the act but strictly not in terms of s.46(1)(b) thereof and that too in the absence of the original registered proprietor.\\nattention has again been drawn to a passage from 'law of trade marks &; geographical indications' by shri k.c.kailasam,wherein the judgment of the tribunal has been criticized in the following terms : \\\"from the above legislative intent,it would seem that the period of non-use of the trade mark is to be reckoned continuously from the date of its registration. in the case of american home products corporation v. mac laboratories pvt.ltd. rendered under the 1958 act,it was held by the supreme court that \\\"the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the register has only to prove. such continuous non-user.\\\"\\nit would appear that neither the u.k.act,nor the indian act,at any time envisaged that the commencement of 5 year period of non-use is to be delinked from the date of registration of the mark,so as to give a fresh lease of life to the registration,every-time there is change in the ownership of the mark.\\nif that be so,any registered proprietor could easily defeat an application for rectification by assigning the mark to some other person to have a fresh period of 5 years from the date of assignment and thus effectively frustrate the very object of the provision in s.47(1)(a) and (b).\\nfurther,it is to be noted that an assignment is subject to \\\"the provisions of the act and any rights vested in any other person\\\" -see. s.37.\\nthe assignor cannot obviously transfer more rights than he himself has to the assignee under the act.\\nan assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses.\\n\\nstatute\\ninterpretation of the provisions of s.46(1)(b)  and section 48 of the trade and merchandise marks act,1958\\n\\n\",\n          \"facts\\ntata consultant engineers,was a partnership firm but subsequently the partnership was dissolved and in 1974 the undertaking became one of the divisions of tata sons limited.\\nit functions as a consulting organisation and a service industry,and does not manufacture any product or carry on trade.its work force consists of engineers and supervisors and different categories of workmen.\\nthe tata consultant employees union served a charter of demands in july,1974,on the appellant,and as their demands were not accepted and conciliation proceedings proved fruitless,the state government made a reference of the dispute under s.10(1)(d),industrial tribunal,maharashtra for adjudication.\\nthe union filed a statement before the tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments.\\nit was urged that the efficiency bar,as a feature of the wage scales,should be removed.\\nthe dearness allowance,it was claimed,should be granted on a slab system.\\nthe claim of the union was resisted by the appellant,who maintained that the existing wage scales were fair and reasonable on a region-cum-industry basis and that it would not be possible for the appellant to bear the additional financial burden if the demands of the union were accepted.\\nthe appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised.\\nthere was no separate dearness allowance until january,1977 when it was introduced for the first time.\\nhouse rent allowance was also paid.\\ndearness allowance became payable at 10% of the basic wage subject to a minimum of rs.50/ and house rent allowance at 30% of the basic salary.\\nthe tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant,an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years,there was definite need for revising the wage scales.\\nit also laid down the principle enabling the actual fitment of the workmen in their respective wage scales as on that date and also provided for the number of increments to which they would be entitled having regard to the period of completed service.\\ntwo days after the award was made,an application was made by the union stating: \\\"in the said award,your honour has observed,at the end of para 22,in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay,i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance.\\\"\\nthe workmen have filed an appeal by special leave, in which they have challenged the rejection by the tribunal of their claim in respect of dearness allowance which,they contend,should be pegged to the cost of living index and should not be a fixed amount.\\n\\nargument\\nconsidering the appeal of tata consulting engineers first,the contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal erred in making the wage scales retrospective and,in any event,in ranging the retrospectivity back to 1st january,1976.\\nthe learned counsel for the appellant had covered a wide field,but in the end he states that the appellant is aggrieved by two matters only.\\none is the retrospectivity attached to the revised wage scales,and the other is the flat increase given to each employee of rs.150/-in the category of draughtsmen and rs.100/-in other categories resulting from the order dated 22nd december,1978.\\nit is urged that the amendment results in the inclusion of a flat increase of rs.150/-to each workman in the case of draughtsman and rs.100/-to each workman in the case of other categories,a result wholly unwarranted,it is said,by the intent of the original award and,therefore,falling beyond the jurisdiction of the tribunal.\\nthe only contention of the workmen is that the tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index.\\n\\nissue\\nthe primary and basic question considered by the industrial tribunal,in making the award dated december 20,1978 was the question of revision of the wage-scales.\\nimplicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage-scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage-scales and flat or ad-hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary.\\n\\nanalysis\\nit must be remembered that although the wage scales were introduced as long ago as 1973 they were maintained at that level except for a slight revision some time thereafter.\\nno dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time.\\nthe cost of living had gone on increasing from 1972 onwards and,as the tribunal has found,the dearness allowance and house rent allowance made no appreciable impact in neutralising the increasing cost.\\nduring all these years,the appellant had continued to enjoy increasing profits; nonetheless the emoluments received by the workmen did not receive the impress of the appellant's growing prosperity.\\nthe charter of demands was presented by the union in july,1974 and when conciliation proceedings failed the state government made the reference to the industrial tribunal in 1975.\\nthey are considerations which cannot be ignored.\\naccordingly,the contention raised on behalf of the appellant against retrospectivity of the wage scales must be rejected.\\nthe financial capacity of the appellant,and the related study of its annual profits from 1968 to 1977,were examined from that view point.\\nthe sufficiency of the existing pay scales was considered in detail,and regard was had to their original structure and the accretions made subsequently by way of dearness allowance and house rent allowance.\\nfor the purpose of restructuring the pay scales the tribunal ruled on the paying capacity of the appellant,both with reference to the profits of the preceding year as well as the prospects of the future.\\nthe financial capacity,as the tribunal observed,constituted one of \\\"the principles which are required to be followed in the fixation of the wage structure.\\\"\\nno ad hoc increase to the pay of each individual workman was intended.\\nthe jurisdiction given to the tribunal by rule 31 is closely circumscribed.\\nit is only a clerical mistake or error which can be corrected,and the clerical mistake or error must arise from an accidental slip or omission in the award.\\nan accidental slip or omission implies that something was intended and contrary to that intention what should not have been included has been included or what should have been included has been omitted.\\nit must be a mistake or error amenable to clerical correction only.\\nit must not be a mistake or error which calls for rectification by modification of the conscious adjudication on the issues involved.\\nthe omission of the words to each employee first after the figure rs.150/-and again after the figure rs.100/-was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the tribunal was entitled to correct.\\nit will be noted that the pay scales of different categories were being restructured,and the flat increase envisaged there related to an increase in the general pay scales of different categories.\\nindividual workmen were not present to the mind of the tribunal.\\nthat the increase was pertinent to the general pay scales in the revised wage structure is patently clear from a comparison of the existing pay scales and the revised pay scales.\\nthe comparative table of existing pay scales and the revised pay scales has been reproduced earlier.\\nthe revised pay scales of all categories,except the category of draughtsmen,shows an increase of rs.100/-in the initial pay fixed in each scale,the increase in the case of the category of draughtsmen being rs.150/.\\nthe amendment made by the tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase,this time to each individual workmen.\\nif,as the tribunal has stated in the amendment order,the increase in paragraph 23 was intended to apply to each individual workmen,there is nothing in the body of the award to form the foundation on which the actual figures in the restructured pay scales can be made to rest.\\nthere will be no explanation why the initial start of the revised pay scales has been increased by rs.150/-in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs.100/-in the case of other categories.\\nconsidering the fitment of the workman in the revised scales,it was stated in the award that a workman found drawing a salary less than the beginning of the grade would be stepped up to the beginning of the grade and if his pay fell between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay was to be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale.\\nreliance was placed on the hindustan times ltd.,new delhi v.their workmen [1964] 1 scr 234 1962 indlaw sc 436,247 where it was observed by this court that dearness allowance should not remain fixed at any figure but should be on a sliding scale in order to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living.\\nnow,it is not a universal rule that the dearness allowance should in all cases be correlated with the cost of living index.\\nit was open to the tribunal to adopt the position which it did.\\nif the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered.\\nthe award is a composite document in which the several elements of increased wage scales,larger increments,longer span of 20 years for earning increments,dearness allowance at 10% of the basic wage,besides several other benefits,have been integrated into a balanced arrangement in keeping with what the tribunal has found to be the financial capacity of the appellant.\\nit is not possible to maintain one part of the award and supersede another.\\nconspicuous by its absence is any reference to a flat increase in the pay of an individual workmen.\\nwe are not impressed with the submission that the corrigendum was in effect a fresh award.\\nwe,therefore,see no ground for quashing the of the tribunal.\\ndearness allowance linked to cost of living index is ordinarily the best and the most scientific method of computing dearness allowance,it cannot always be said that an illegality warranting interference under article 136 is committed if some other method is adopted.\\nthe tribunal has given satisfactory reason for adopting a different mode and we are not disposed to interfere with the award of the tribunal.\\n\\nstatute\\nin making the application of 22nd december,1978,the union invoked the jurisdiction of the tribunal under rule 31 of the industrial disputes (bombay) rules,1957.\\nrule 31 provides: the labour court,tribunal or arbitrator may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any award it or he issues.\\nthe application before the tribunal was filed under rule 31 of the bombay industrial disputes rules 1957,which is as follows: \\\"a board,court,labour court,tribunal or arbitrator may,at any time,suo moto or on an application made by any of the parties concerned,may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any proceedings,report,award or as the case may be\\\".\\n\\n\",\n          \"facts\\nujjagar singh, the appellant herein, was tried and convicted by the additional sessions judge, sangrur for the murder of his niece mukhtiar kaur and was awarded the death penalty.\\nin addition, he was convicted for an offence punishable u/s. 376 of the ipc and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to a fine of rs.5, 000/- and in default of payment to undergo further r.i. for one year and u/s. 309 of the ipc to a sentence of simple imprisonment for one year.\\nthe aforesaid convictions and sentences have been maintained by the high court and the matter is before us in these proceedings by way of special leave.\\nat about 2.00 p.m. on 10th november 2002 a boy whose identity is not forthcoming, informed satnam singh pw2 that an incident of firing had taken place in the house of ujjagar singh .\\nsatnam singh conveyed this information to sarpanch jora singh pw1 who was attending a marriage at that time.\\njora singh accompanied by gurdeep singh pw3 thereupon rushed to ujjagar singh's house and found mukhtiar kaur lying dead with a gun shot injury and the appellant also with a gun shot injury lying unconscious on the ground in the adjoining room.\\nit appears that mukhtiar kaur's relations with her in-laws had got strained and she had left her matrimonial home and come to live with ujjagar singh, her uncle, 7 or 8 months earlier and the suggestion was that mukhtiar kaur had been killed by the appellant with his licensed gun and he had thereafter attempted to commit suicide.\\n\\nargument\\nthe learned counsel for the accused has raised several arguments in the course of hearing.\\nhe has pointed out that there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that mukhtiar kaur had been subjected to rape and in this view of the matter the very basis for the imposition of the death penalty was not made out.\\nhe has also pointed out that there were no eye witnesses to the incident and the 4 witnesses i.e. jora singh and others who had reached the place of incident and carried the injured appellant to the hospital had also resiled and as the prosecution story now rested on circumstantial evidence alone, it was imperative for the investigating officer to have taken the finger prints from the weapon and that in any case the recovery of the spent cartridges and the gun were clearly suspicious as the weapon had been sent to the laboratory after an inordinate delay.\\nit has also been submitted that in a case of attempted suicide a firearm must of necessity be used from a very close range and the absence of any blackening, charring or burning around the wound on ujjagar singh clearly ruled out the possibility of such an attempt.\\nit has finally been submitted that the land had been transferred in the name of ujjagar singh's sons in the year 1994 by gurmail kaur, mother of mukhtiar kaur by a collusive decree and there was no evidence to show that mukhtiar kaur had ever displayed any unhappiness or made any complaint to any person or any authority with regard to the decree and as such, the very basis of the prosecution story did not exist.\\nhe had laid great emphasis on the fact that no reference to the gun or cartridges had been made in the inquest report and that in any case the weapon and the spent cartridges had been sent to the laboratory belatedly.\\n\\nissue\\nconvictions and sentences by the high court should be maintained or not?\\n\\nanalysis\\nfrom the medical evidence and from the chemical examiner's reports that the vaginal swab and clothes taken from the dead body did indicate the presence of semen.\\nthere is however absolutely no evidence to suggest (even assuming that the intercourse had been committed by the appellant) that he had done so without mukhtiar kaur's consent or against her will.\\nit is also significant that the investigators had made no attempt whatsoever to have the appellant medically examined to ascertain his capacity to perform sexual intercourse.\\nit must nonetheless be emphasized that whether a chain is complete or not would depend on the facts of each case emanating from the evidence and no universal yardstick should ever be attempted.\\nit is in this background that we must examine the circumstances in the present case.\\na few facts stand out from the prosecution story.\\nfirst, the place of incident being adjoining rooms in the residential house of the appellant and the fact that the alleged murder weapon is his licensed dbbl gun is proved on record.\\nthe evidence also reveals that the appellant was living in the premises along with his wife, mother and son, and two daughters, who were studying outside the village, were frequent visitors, but it is the admitted position that nobody but the appellant and the deceased were present at the time of incident.\\nit is also clear from the evidence that the two spent cartridge cases recovered, one from near mukhtiar kaur's dead body, and the second from the right barrel of the gun lying near the appellant had been sent to the forensic science laboratory which opined that one of the cartridges had been fired from the gun and the other could have been fired therefrom.\\nit is true that in a case relating to circumstantial evidence motive does assume great importance but to say that the absence of motive would dislodge the entire prosecution story is perhaps giving this one factor an importance which is not due and (to use the clichi. the motive is in the mind of the accused and can seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy.\\nthere is however a hint in the testimony of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh that his enquiries had revealed that the accused was having illicit relations with mukhtiar kaur and we can assume that some thing untoward had happened which could have triggered the volatile and hostile incident.\\nthere could perhaps be some truth in this suggestion, as it is significant that though the appellant had an extended family living with him i.e. mother, wife, son living (in the village) and two young daughters who were studying outside and residing in a hostel, but were frequent visitors home, yet none of them has come forth to depose in his favour.\\ntherefore, this is yet another circumstance inculpating the accused.\\nit is also significant that the shot had apparently travelled upwards skirting the mandible, through the flesh of the cheek in an upward direction with minimal damage to the bone structure and it is indeed providential that the appellant got away with only an injury, albeit a very serious one.\\nthe fact that the shot was fired from below going upwards is also supported by the site plan exh. pjj wherein marks of a shot hitting the roof were seen at point e whereas the appellant was found lying at point d in the same room.\\nit is therefore apparent that the weapon had indeed been fired by the appellant from a close range and that the blackened portion around the wound had been removed by dr. sanjay uppal.\\nit is true that it is generally for the prosecution to prove its case beyond doubt but in circumstances such as the present one, some explanation is also due from an accused in order to absolve himself from suspicion of the crime.\\nno part of the evidence of the hostile witnesses comes to the aid of the appellant.\\nthe question now arises as to the sentence that should be imposed on the appellant.\\nit would be seen that both the sessions court and the high court were appalled by the allegations and findings of incestuous rape and murder.\\nwe are however of the opinion, as already noted above, that a case of rape has not been made out.\\nin this background the death sentence is not called for.\\n\\nstatute\\nsection 376, 309 of ipc\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

the order of the board and directed it to adjudicate the dispute on merits \\nthe said order of the division bench is under challenge in this appeal \\nthe core question which arises for our consideration is as to whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case the application under s 461b was maintainable \\nbefore adverting thereto we may take notice of the relevant statutory provisions ss 461b481482 and 56 read as under section 46 removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non use  1 subject to the provisions of section 47a registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application made in the prescribed manner to a high court or to the registrar by any person aggrieved on the ground either a b that up to a date one month before the date of the application a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being provided that except where the applicant has been permitted under sub s 3 of s 12 to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of the goods in question or where the tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark the tribunal may refuse an application u cl a or cl b in relation to any goods if it is shown that there has been before the relevent date or during the relevant period as the case may be bona fide use of the trade mark by any proprietor thereof for the time being in relation to goods of the same description being goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered \\nsection 48 registered users  1 subject to the provisions of section 49a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as the registered user thereof in respect of any or all of the goods in respect of which the trademark is registered otherwise than as a defensive trade mark but the central government may by rules made in this behalf provide that no application for registration as such shall be enertained unless the agreement between the parties complies with the conditions laid down in the rules for preventing trafficking in trade marks \\nthe permitted use of a trade mark shall be deemed to be used by the proprietor thereof and shall be deemed not to be used by a person other than the proprietor for the purposes of s 46 or for any other purpose for which such use is material under this act or any other law \\nsection 56 power to cancel or vary registration and to rectify the register  1 \\non application made in the prescribed manner to a high court or to the registrar by

by any entry wrongly remaining on the register or by any error of defect in any entry in the register may apply in the prescribed manner to a high court or to the registrar and the tribunal may make such order for making expunging or varying the entry as it may think fit \\nthe tribunal may in any proceeding under this section decide any question that may be necessary or expedient to decide in

the prescribed manner who shall upon receipt of such notice rectify the register accordingly \\nthe power to rectify the register conferred by this section shall include the power to remove a trade mark registered in part a of the register to part b of the register \\nindisputably the scope of the provisions for removal from register in terms of s 46 and 56 of the act stand on different footings \\nwhereas s 46 had a limited application s 56 of the act is wider in nature \\nconcededly cl a of sub s 1 of s 46 is not attracted in the case \\nfor the purpose of appreciation of the rival contentions we may notice the findings of the board as also the high court \\nthe board has taken the view that the period of five years and one month will begin to run from the date on which thukral became the proprietor of the trademark that is30th may1986 and therefore the rectification application could have been filed by the appellant only sometime in 1991 opining that an application for rectification against the appellant within a period of seven and a half months from the date of assignment of the trade mark was not maintainable the application was dismissed \\nthe high court on the other hand opined it was not anybody  s case before us that m s jain industries \\nthe registered proprietor of the trademark used it at all \\nthe trademark was used by the appellant and thukral neither of whom were proprietors thereof except that thukral claims to have become its proprietor with effect from 30th may1986 according to learned counsel for the appellant the use of the trademark by thukral was not legally permissible use inasmuch as thukral did not have the consent tacit or otherwise of m s jain industries to use the trademark \\nif thukral did then it can not be said that there was no bona fide use thereof by its proprietor \\nthat is m s jain industries \\nthis appears to be the position at least till 30th may1986 in \\nthe meantime as a result of the ex parte ad interim injunction granted on 19th december 1985 by this court in suit no 2408 of 1985there was no question of thukral using the trademark field marshal till the injunction was vacated on 19th january1988 \\nthe act was enacted to provide for the registration and better protection of trademarks and for the prevention of the use of fraudulent marks of merchandise \\nregistration of a trade mark remains valid for seven years \\nrenewal applications are required to be filed on the expiry of seven years \\nm s jain industries got itself registered and obtained periodical renewal thereof as is required under the act \\nfirst respondent withdrew the application against m s jain industries \\nthe prayer in the application was to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps goods so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned \\nit is in the aforementioned situation we are called upon to determine the meaning of the words for the time being occurring in s 461b of the act \\ntwo interpretations thereto which are possible are 1 the said words would denote non use of the trade mark in relation to the goods by the appellant for a period of five years or longer and 2 the mark had not been used for a period of five years or longer either by the present proprietor thereof or his predecessor \\nwe may however also notice that another construction of the said provision has been put forth by mr sunderam learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that the word proprietor would not mean a registered proprietor but also a person who has become proprietor by long use thereof \\nthe words for the time being would mean differently in different situations \\nit may mean the moment or existing position as was held by this court in the case of jivendra nath kaul v collector district magistrate and anr 1992 \\n3 scc 576 1992 indlaw sc 1107 or in the context of cl 22 of art 366 of the

recognition to a ruler nor with authority to recognize or not to recognize a ruler arbitrarily the expression for them time being predicts that there shall be a ruler of the indian state that if the first recognized ruler dies or ceases to be a ruler a successor shall be appointed and that there shall not be more rulers than one at a given time \\nthe terms also may bring within its umbrage the entire period of five years or more irrespective of the fact as to whether the registered proprietor was one or more than one as has been held by the high court \\nthere can not be any doubt or dispute that the registration of a trade mark confers a very valuable right \\nthe person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods as that of the registered owner \\nit confers an exclusive right of use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in which the trade mark is registered \\nthe same is an assignable right in terms of s 36 of the act whereas an unregistered trade mark is not \\nuser of the said mark therefore entails the consequences laid down under cl b of sub s 1 of s 46 \\nhowever such an application can be filed only by a person aggrieved \\nwhen the applicant before the board establishes the fact in regard to non user of the mark for a period of more than five years on the part of the registered owner the latter may show that his case falls within the purview of sub s 3 of s 46 \\nthe question which therefore arises is as to who can prove that he had the bona fide intention to use the trade mark on the date of application for registration \\nindisputably it would be the registered proprietor \\ns 46 is a penal provision \\nit provides for civil or evil consequences \\nit takes away the valuable right of a registered proprietor \\nit therefore can be taken away only when the conditions laid down therefor are satisfied \\nwhile we say so we are not oblivious of the fact that trafficking in trade mark is to be discouraged \\na registered proprietor of a trade mark should not be permitted to circumvent the law of user of the trade mark for a long time by assigning the same from time to time \\nbut then such a case has to be made out \\nallegation of trafficking is a serious one \\nit must be proved in presence of the person against whom such allegations are made \\nat the time of grant of original registration advertisements are issued and objections are called for \\nrenewal of registration in a sense also is not automatic \\na person who had been using the said trade mark as a proprietor thereof by user is supposed to keep itself abreast with such applications filed by another either for registration of the trade mark or renewal thereof \\nthe non user for a long time would disentitle a registered proprietor from renewal of the registration \\nit must not however be forgotten that s 461b provides for a special remedy \\nas a person obtains a right on and from the date of registration andor renewal thereof he can ordinarily be deprived of his right unless it is shown that the assignment thereof by his holder was not a bona fide one or had been made by way of camouflage \\nif the assignee has obtained assignment for bona fide use he may not be fastened with any liability owing to non user on the part of his predecessor \\nin other words the mistake of the predecessor should not be visited with non use of the present registered owner \\nit must however be observed that whether a use is for bona fide purpose would essentially be a question of fact \\nwhether s 461b read with s 48 of the act would bring within its purview not only a registered proprietor but also the proprietor who had otherwise acquired a right would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case \\nin kabushiki kaisha toshiba v tosiba appliances co ors 2008 8 scale 354 2008 indlaw sc 1395this court held we do not find any force in the aforementioned submission

certain special circumstances a continuous use is not possible \\nthe trade mark for which registration is obtained is used intermittently \\nsuch non user for a temporary period may be due to any

purposes of removal on the ground of non use under s 46 has a different connotation from the phrase used in s 56 for canceling or expunging or varying an entry wrongly made or remaining in the register \\nthe submission of mr sudhir chandra \\nthat the appellant was an infringer both of the right of m s jain industries as also the first respondent and thus its use was not bona fide in a case of this nature can not be accepted \\nif appellant infringed the right of m s jain industries it was for it to take action there for \\nit did not \\nfirst respondent itself accepts that at least immediately prior to the institution of the suit appellant had been using the same \\nwe are not concerned herein as to since when it had been doing so \\nit obtained an or of injunction \\nthe order of injunction was vacated \\nfor one reason or the other the said order attained finality \\nprima facie therefore appellant has been held to be the registered owner of the trade mark \\nit is one thing to say that for the purpose of frustrating an application for rectification the appellant had colluded with its predecessor for the purpose of trafficking by entering into the deed of assignment which is otherwise illegal and bad in law \\nbut it is another thing to say that the appellant could be proceeded against alone for non user of the registered trade mark for a period of more than five years \\nfor the purpose of making out such a case both the original registrants as also the assignee were required to be impleaded as parties \\nwe may at this stage notice that in law of trade marks by mr k c kailasam while commenting on s 47 of the trade marks act1999 to which our attention has been drawn by mr sudhir chandra it is stated \\nnotes on clauses \\nthis clause corresponds to s 46 of the existing act and provides for removal of a trade mark from the register on the ground of non use \\na trade mark which is not used within five years of its registration becomes liable for removal either completely or in respect of those goods or services for which the mark has not been used \\nunder s 461it is proposed to clarify that the five years period will start from the date on which the trade mark is actually entered on the register \\nthis amendment is intended to remove any ambiguity as for all other purposes the date of registration will be the date on which the application was filed vide cl 232 proviso to sub cl 1 also provides that the tribunal may refuse removal of the mark if it is shown that any proprietor had in fact made bona fide use of the trademark for goods or services of the same description or associated goods or services \\nit is also proposed to increase the period from 1 to 3 months in cl 471a and b in which use of the trade mark prior to the date of filing of the application for removal of the trade mark shall be disregarded \\nthis is intended to prevent the registered proprietor to by pass the act by such token use after he comes to know that an application for removal is about to be filed sub cl 3 protects a mark from being removed from the register on ground of non use if such non use is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade \\nthe clause is proposed to be modified to clarify that special circumstances in the trade will include restrictions imposed by any law or regulation on the use of trade mark in india \\nconsequential amendments have been made to cover services cl 47 of the bill \\nthe court while construing a statute takes into consideration the parliamentary intent in amending the provisions thereof \\nit seeks to enhance the period of moratorium of use of the registered trade mark from one month to three months so as to prevent speculative assignment \\nthus a case of speculative assignment is specifically required to be made out \\nsuch an application may be maintainable in terms of s 56 of the act but strictly not in terms of s 461b thereof and that too in the absence of the original registered proprietor \\nwe are not satisfied with the explanation offered by the first respondent that it gave up the case of non use of the registered trade mark against m s jain industries on the basis of statement made by the learned counsel for the appellant firstly because consent does not confer jurisdiction secondly because want andor lack of jurisdiction on the part of the tribunal can not be waived as if any order is passed without jurisdiction the same would be a nullity and thirdly because the cause of action even according to the first respondent in his application before the high court was different \\nthe counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant did not state that it had waived its right so far as non impleadment of m s jain industries was concerned \\nit only consented for grant of liberty in favour of the first respondent for filing of an application for the self same cause of action \\nthe question of maintainability of the second suit is absence of the registrant proprietor was not and could not have been the subject matter of consent at that stage \\nthe cause of action which permitted the first respondent to file an application for rectification against m s jain industries was non user thereof by it \\nits non user and rectification of the register could not in the aforementioned situation have been tagged with the cause of action if any against the appellant \\nthe second contention of mr that the appellant was an infringer of the trade mark is again a question of fact \\nthe right of the first respondent as a proprietor of the trade mark by reason of a long user is required to be determined vis  vis m s jain industries as also the appellant in the suit filed by it which is pending \\nthe board could not while exercising its jurisdiction under s 461bof the act proceeded on the basis of such presumption \\nit is not correct that no cause of action survived against jain industries \\nit was not lost by reason of assignment as was contended by the learned counsel \\nin the suit only the competing right of the first respondent qua the appellant can be determined and not a right against m s such a right can not be determined in a proceeding under s 461b of the act which is restricted to non user of the registered trade mark \\nboth the appellant and the respondent no 1 were the infringers of the right of m s jain industries as it was the registered proprietor of the trade mark in respect of the goods in question namely centrifugal pumps \\ntwo interpretations of the said provision s 461b are possible \\nwhile interpreting the same however certain basic principles of construction of statute must be kept in mind \\nas it takes away somebody  s right it deserves strict construction \\njurisdiction of the board being dependent on determination of the foundational facts the same was required to be established on the basis of the averments made in the application and not otherwise \\nthe right of a registered trade mark is not lost automatically on the expiry of five years and one month \\nit does not provide for a sun set law \\nit has to be adjudicated upon \\nwhether the registered proprietor of the trade mark had taken recourse to trafficking or not must be determined in an appropriate proceeding \\nthe principle of purchaser of a property has a duty to make enquiriestherefore cannot apply in a case of this nature \\nso long as the right to assign a registered trade mark remains valid once the same is validly assigned the assignee derives the same right as that of the assignor in terms of the statute \\na title to a trade mark derived on assignment as provided for under the act can not be equated with a defective title acquired in any other property as admittedly on the date of assignment the right of the registered trade mark was not extinguished \\nboth the findings of the high court which we have noticed hereinbefore are findings on question of law and in that view of the matter the contention of mr sudhir chandra that the merit of the matter is yet to be gone into by the board can not be a ground for ignoring the submissions made at the bar \\nour attention has again been drawn to a passage from law of trade marks geographical indications by shri k c kailasam wherein the judgment of the tribunal has been criticized in the following terms from the above legislative intent it would seem that the period of non use of the trade mark is to be reckoned continuously from the date of its registration \\nin the case of american home products corporation v mac laboratories pvt ltd \\nrendered under the 1958 act it was held by the supreme court that the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the register has only to prove \\nsuch continuous non user \\nit would appear that neither the u k act nor the indian act at any time envisaged that the commencement of 5 year period of non use is to be delinked from the date of registration of the mark so as to give a fresh lease of life to the registration every time there is change in the ownership of the mark \\nif that be so any registered proprietor could easily defeat an application for rectification by assigning the mark to some other person to have a fresh period of 5 years from the date of assignment and thus effectively frustrate the very object of the provision in s 471a and b further it is to be noted that an assignment is subject to the provisions of the act and any rights vested in any other person see \\ns 37 the assignor can not obviously transfer more rights than he himself has to the assignee under the act \\nwe do not think that the approach of the learned author is entirely correct \\nan assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses \\nif his title is not extinguished by reason of a provision of a statute for non user of the trade mark for a period of five years any assignment made shall be valid subject to such situation which we have noticed in paragraph 25 supra \\nfor the views we have taken we are of the opinion that the impugned judgment can not be sustained \\nit is set aside accordingly \\nthe board shall however proceed to determine afresh the application filed by the first in the light of the legal principles explained above \\nthe appeal is allowed with costs \\ncounsel  s fee assessed at rs 100000 \\nappeal allowed \\n\",\n          \"this appeal by special leave has been preferred by tata consultancy engineers against an award dated 20th december1978 of the industrial tribunal maharashtra bombay revising the wage scales of certain categories of employees and granting various other benefits \\ntata consultant engineers at its inception was a partnership firm but subsequently the partnership was dissolved and in 1974 the undertaking became one of the divisions of tata sons limited \\nit functions as a consulting organisation and a service industry and does not manufacture any product or carry on trade \\nits work force consists of engineers and supervisors and different categories of workmen \\nout of 665 employees at bombay the draftsmen and the administrative staff number 306 these workmen are members of the tata consultant employees union \\nthey served a charter of demands in july1974on the appellant and as their demands were not accepted and conciliation proceedings proved fruitless the state government made a reference of the dispute under s 101 dindustrial tribunal maharashtra for adjudication \\nthe reference was numbered i t no 292 of 1975 \\nthe union filed a statement before the tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments \\nit was urged that the efficiency bar as a feature of the wage scales should be removed \\nthe dearness allowance it was claimed should be granted on a slab system \\nthe claim of the union was resisted by the appellant who maintained that the existing wage scales were fair and reasonable on a region cum industry basis and that it would not be possible for the appellant to bear the additional financial burden if the demands of the union were accepted \\nreference was made to the political uncertainty in iran which had placed an appreciable part of the appellant  s business in jeopardy and to various other factors peculiar to an engineering consultancy business beyond the appellant  s control \\nthere was fierce competition also it was asserted from other similar organisations \\nthe appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised \\nthere was no separate dearness allowance until january1977 when it was introduced for the first time \\nhouse rent allowance was also paid \\ndearness allowance became payable at 10 of the basic wage subject to a minimum of rs 50 and house rent allowance at 30 of the basic salary \\nnothing those facts the tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years there was definite need for revising the wage scales \\nit was pointed out that the dearness allowance and house rent allowance granted by the appellant made little impact in neutralising the cost of living \\nthe need for revising the wage scales was not disputed by the appellant \\nin proceeding to revise the wage structure the tribunal took into account the two principles involved in the process the financial capacity of the industry to bear the burden of an increased wage bill and the prevailing wage structure on an industry cum region basis \\nwage scale statements were filed by the parties before the tribunal pertaining to several engineering consultancy organisations but \\nin the absence of pertinent information concerning the strength of their labour force the extent of their business the financial position for some years the capital invested the precise nature of the business the position regarding reserves dividends declared and future prospects of the company the tribunal found that it was unable to rely on them as comparable concerns \\nholding it impossible in the circumstances to apply the principle of industry cum region basis the tribunal turned to a consideration of the financial capacity of the company to bear an additional burden in this connection it proceeded on the footing that the appellant was a separate and independent division of tata sons limited and had no functional integrality with the other divisions \\nhaving regard to the net profits earned by the appellant from 1968 to 1977 it found that the acceptance of the demands of the union would result in an increased burden of rs 7 crores a burden which would dry up the appellant  s resources and would be impossible for it to bear \\nthe union modified its demands but even the modified terms according to the tribunal appeared to be on the high side inasmuch as the resulting total burden of rs 1 70 crores was much higher than the average profits could sustain \\nthe particular character of the appellant that it was a service industry and not a manufacturing concern was taken into account and it was observed that unlike a manufacturing business there was little scope for diversification in the case of an engineering consultancy \\nnonetheless the tribunal observed there was every reason to expect that the appellant would be able to earn sound profits in the future and the instability in its business activities occasioned by the turbulent political situation in iran would be it was expected compensated by contracts secured in different developing countries \\nfor the purpose of determining the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal followed unichem laboratories v their workmen 1972 indlaw sc 181 where it was held that the gross profits should be computed without making deductions on account of taxation development rebate and depreciation \\nit decided also that there was no ground for deducting the notional value of gratuity \\nrevising the figures on that basis it computed the annual gross profits for the years 1968 to 1977 and determined the annual average at rs 26 69 lakhs \\nthe tribunal took note of the elaborate scales of wages already existing in the wage structure of the appellant and decided to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category \\nit also observed that the category of draughtsmen needed a special increase \\nbut it rejected the demand of the union for dearness allowance on the basis of a slab system because that would have imposed an unacceptable burden on the appellant  s financial capacity and there was no reason why the existing scheme of dearness allowance should be disturbed when a substantial increase was being made in the level of the basic wage \\ntaking into account the circumstance that besides the staff of 306 workmen represented by the union there were several other employees who would also have to be paid the tribunal considered it fair in paragraph 23 of the award to give a flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories \\nit rejected the demand of the union for abolishing the efficiency bar but the span of 15 years for earning increment was expanded in some grades to 20 years and some adjustments were also made in specific grades \\nthe tribunal also noted that after the salaries of the employees had been fixed in the respective scales senior employees would have to be given some more increments in the new scales according to their completed years of service \\ntaking all these factors into consideration it made an award dated 20th december1978 prescribing the following revision in the existing scales of wages \\nthe tribunal maintained the existing schemes of dearness allowance and house rent allowance and observed that in view of the revised basic wages there would be a resultant increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance \\nthe revised wage scales the tribunal directed should take effect retrospectively from 1st january1976 it also laid down the principle enabling the actual fitment of the workmen in their respective wage scales as on that date and also provided for the number of increments to which they would be entitled having regard to the period of completed service \\ntwo days after the award was made an application was made by the union stating in the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance \\nfurther it appears that the tribunal intended to grant the increase of rs 150 to each draughtsman and rs 100 to all other workmen in their basic pay \\nhowever this is not clearly mentioned anywhere in the award due to accidental slip or omission \\nthe union prayed that the position may be clarified and the award corrected accordingly \\non the same date the tribunal disposed of the application by the following order there can be no doubt that a flat increase of rs 150 to each of the employees in the category of draftsmen and of rs 100 to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award \\nthe same has been made clear in paragraph \\nno 23but it appears that the words to each employee after the figure rs 150 were omitted \\nsimilarly the same words to each employee after the figure 100 were omitted \\nwhen the award is sent for publication a necessary corrigendum be made in the award and the aforesaid words after the figures rs 150 and rs 100 be added \\nit may be mentioned that only from that point of view viz to grant flat increase of rs 150 and of rs 100 to the employees in the category of draftsmen and the other categories respectively that a burden statement was called for from the company and the same was submitted vide exhibit c 51 the fitment has also to be done only after the flat increase is added to the present basic salary of each employee \\ni do not think that any problem would arise for interpretation of the award \\nsince the award has been already signed i do not think anything further can be added to this award \\nsd k n wani industrial tribunal \\nin this appeal the learned counsel for the appellant had covered a wide field but in the end he states that the appellant is aggrieved by two matters only \\none is the retrospectivity attached to the revised wage scales and the other is the flat increase given to each employee of rs 150 in the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in other categories resulting from the order dated 22nd december1978 \\nthe workmen have filed an appeal by special leave civil appeal no 2300 of 1979in which they have challenged the rejection by the tribunal of their claim in respect of dearness allowance which they contend should be pegged to the cost of living index and should not be a fixed amount \\nconsidering the appeal of tata consulting engineers first the contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal erred in making the wage scales retrospective and in any event in ranging the retrospectivity back to 1st january1976 \\nwe have been taken through some of the material on the record in the attempt to support the contention but after giving careful thought to the matter i think there is ample justification for what the tribunal did \\nit must be remembered that although the wage scales were introduced as long ago as 1973 they were maintained at that level except for a slight revision some time thereafter \\nno dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time \\nthe cost of living had gone on increasing from 1972 onwards and as the tribunal has found the dearness allowance and house rent allowance made no appreciable impact in neutralising the increasing cost \\nduring all these years the appellant had continued to enjoy increasing profits nonetheless the emoluments received by the workmen did not receive the impress of the appellant  s growing prosperity \\nthe charter of demands was presented by the union in july1974 and when conciliation proceedings failed the state government made the reference to the industrial tribunal in 1975 the tribunal has referred to various considerations which prevailed with it in giving retrospectivity to the revised pay scales \\nthey are considerations which can not be ignored \\naccordingly the contention raised on behalf of the appellant against retrospectivity of the wage scales must be rejected \\nthe challenge embodied in the second contention against the amendment of the award is more serious \\nit is urged that the amendment results in the inclusion of a flat increase of rs 150 to each workman in the case of draughtsman and rs 100 to each workman in the case of other categories a result wholly unwarranted it is said by the intent of the original award and therefore falling beyond the jurisdiction of the tribunal \\nin making the application of 22nd \\ndecember1978the union invoked the jurisdiction of the \\ntribunal under rule 31 of the industrial disputes bombay rules1957 rule 31 provides the labour court tribunal or arbitrator may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any award it or he issues \\nthe jurisdiction given to the tribunal by rule 31 is closely circumscribed \\nit is only a clerical mistake or error which can be corrected and the clerical mistake or error must arise from an accidental slip or omission in the award \\nan accidental slip or omission implies that something was intended and contrary to that intention what should not have been included has been included or what should have been included has been omitted \\nit must be a mistake or error amenable to clerical correction only \\nit must not be a mistake or error which calls for rectification by modification of the conscious adjudication on the issues involved \\nis the instant case one where the amendment made by the tribunal in the original award can be said to correct a mere clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission \\nto answer the question it is necessary to examine the basis of the award and the intent which flows from that basis \\nthe terms of reference in the state government  s order required the tribunal to revise the scales of pay and dearness allowance and there was no mention of giving any ad hoc increase in the basic pay of individual workman \\nit would do well to recall that the claim of the union filed before the tribunal also centered on the need to revise the wage scales \\nthat was the main issue between the parties \\nit is to the task of revising the pay scales that the tribunal addressed itself and throughout the material part of the award it is that task which held its focussed attention \\nthe financial capacity of the appellant and the related study of its annual profits from 1968 to 1977were examined from that view point \\nthe sufficiency of the existing pay scales was considered in detail and regard was had to their original structure and the accretions made subsequently by way of dearness allowance and house rent allowance \\nfor the purpose of restructuring the pay scales the tribunal ruled on the paying capacity of the appellant both with reference to the profits of the preceding year as well as the prospects of the future \\nthe financial capacity as the tribunal observed constituted one of the principles which are required to be followed in the fixation of the wage structure \\na clear statement of its intention is found in paragraph 22 of the award where the tribunal stated i only propose to modify the existing structures of the scales with flat increases in each category \\nno ad hoc increase to the pay of each individual workman was intended \\nand that is confirmed by what was stated in paragraph 23 of the award considering this outgoing the flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draughtsman and rs 100 in the case of the other categories would be fair \\nit will be noted that the pay scales of different categories were being restructured and the flat increase envisaged there related to an increase in the general pay scales of different categories \\nindividual workmen were not present to the mind of the tribunal \\nthat the increase was pertinent to the general pay scales in the revised wage structure is patently clear from a comparison of the existing pay scales and the revised pay scales \\nthe comparative table of existing pay scales and the revised pay scales has been reproduced earlier \\nthe revised pay scales of all categories except the category of draughtsmen shows an increase of rs 100 in the initial pay fixed in each scale the increase in the case of the category of draughtsmen being rs 150  there was only one increase contemplated in the award in paragraph 23 of award and it is more than plain that the increase was the one incorporated in the revised pay scales pertaining to different categories \\nno second flat increase was envisaged at all \\nthe amendment made by the tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase this time to each individual workmen \\nif as the tribunal has stated in the amendment order the increase in paragraph 23 was intended to apply to each individual workmen there is nothing in the body of the award to form the foundation on which the actual figures in the restructured pay scales can be made to rest \\nthere will be no explanation why the initial start of the revised pay scales has been increased by rs 150 in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories \\nconsidering the fitment of the workman in the revised scales it was stated in the award that a workman found drawing a salary less than the beginning of the grade would be stepped up to the beginning of the grade and if his pay fell between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay was to be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale \\nconspicuous by its absence is any reference to a flat increase in the pay of an individual workmen \\neven when considering the range of permissible retrospectivity the tribunal stated in the award in view of the revision of the wage scales there would be consequent increase in the dearness allowance and the house rent allowance \\nand the clinching circumstances of all is that the award was made on the basis that the overall financial load according to paragraph 33 of the award would be to the tune of about rs 5 lakhs \\nit was that figure which the tribunal had in mind against the backdrop of the gross annual figures when it made the revised pay scales retrospective from 1st \\njanuary1976 this liability taken with the liability accruing on the need to increase the salaries of the other staff determined the tribunal  s deliberations in regard to the several features of the award including the grant of increments related to completed periods of service the expansion of the span from 15 years to 20 years for earning increments and other benefits \\nit can not be the case of the union that the figure of rs 5 lakhs mentioned in paragraph 33 of the award represented the result of adding a flat increase to the pay of each workman in addition to the benefits conferred by the revised pay scales and other awarded reliefs \\nin its order of 22nd \\ndecember1978the tribunal has referred to the statement exhibit c 51 filed by the appellant when called upon to indicate the increased financial burden apprehended by it \\nthe tribunal has relied on this statement as evidence showing that the appellant knew that a flat increase of rs 150 and rs 100 was intended to each of the employees in the category of draughtsmen and the other categories \\nin so construing the statement exhibit c 51the tribunal has grievously erred \\nit seems from a perusal of the document exhibit c 51that it is a statement giving trial figures of the increased financial load on different bases \\non the basis that a sum of rs 150 per month was added to the pay of each draughtsman and a sum of rs 100 was added to the pay of every other workman who belonged to the union staff the financial load would increase to rs 922032  likewise if a flat increase of rs 100 was given to individual workmen of all categories including draughtsmen the increased financial load would total rs 764256  the statement then goes on to indicate that if a flat increase of rs 75 per month were given to individual workmen of all categories the total increase would be rs 578220  again if the flat increase is rs 65 per month to the individual workmen of all categories the additional load would total rs 497772  finally on the basis that the individual draughtsman would be given an increase of rs 75 per month and the individual workmen of other categories rs 50 per month the additional load was calculated at rs 463092  it will be noted that the statement exhibit c 51was prepared on the basis of the employees strength as in december1971 a similar statement was prepared on the basis of the employees strength as in september1978 these statements can not be regarded as evidence that the appellant was cognizant of the intention of the tribunal to provide a flat increase to the pay of each workman \\nthe statement afforded an indication merely of what the additional financial load would be if a flat increase was given to the individual workman on the alternative basis set forth therein \\nnone of the alternatives was actually adopted by the tribunal because when the award was made the tribunal proceeded instead to restructure the wage scales by the addition of rs 150 in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories to the initial pay in the wage scales pertaining to those categories \\nthe addition was integrated as a feature of the wage scales it was not regarded as an addition to the pay of each individual workman \\nit seems that the tribunal was betrayed by a curious confusion in accepting the plea of the union that a flat increase to the pay of each workman was intended in the original wage and consequently it fell into the error of amending the award \\nthe evidence contained in the award throughout provides incontrovertible proof that this flat increase was never originally intended in the award \\nthe amendment has resulted in the tribunal making as it were a supplementary award whereby a further relief is being granted beyond that granted in the original award \\nthe original award was completed and signed by the tribunal and it can not be reopened now except for the limited purpose of rule 31 in travelling outside and beyond the terms of the original award the tribunal has committed a jurisdictional error \\nour attention has been drawn to what purports to be an endorsement by counsel for the appellant on the application dated 22nd december1978 filed by the union before the tribunal to the effect that the appellant would submit to whatever the tribunal decided and it is urged that the appellant is bound by the order made on the application \\nit is an accepted principle that consent by a party can not confer jurisdiction on a court \\nwhat is without jurisdiction will remain so \\nin the circumstances the order of 22nd december1978 is invalid so far as it amends paragraph 23 of the original award \\nthe corrigendum amending the award in consequence is liable to be quashed \\nthe second contention of the appellant is entitled to succeed \\ni shall now consider civil appeal no 2300 of 1979 filed by the workmen \\nthe only contention of the workmen is that the tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index \\nit is wrong in principle it is said to provide a fixed dearness allowance \\nreliance was placed on the hindustan times ltd new delhi v their workmen 1964 1 scr 234 1962 indlaw sc 436247 where it was observed by this court that dearness allowance should not remain fixed at any figure but should be on a sliding scale in order to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living \\nreference was also made to bengal chemical pharmaceutical works limited v its workmen \\n2 scr 113 1968 indlaw sc 183 now it is not a universal rule that the dearness allowance should in all cases be correlated with the cost of living index \\nthe tribunal in the present case considered the matter and found it sufficient and in accord with justice that the wage scales should be restructured with suitable increments provided therein \\nit noted that dearness allowance was being granted by the appellant at 10 of the salary subject to a minimum of rs 50 and house rent allowance at 30 of the basic salary \\nhaving regard to the not inconsiderable improvement in the level of the basic wage it observed that there would be a consequent increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance \\nin view of the increase so secured the tribunal rejected the suggestion that a slab system should be introduced in the dearness allowance or that there should be any other modification of the principle on which dearness allowance was being presently granted \\nit declared that the cumulative effect of an improved wage structure together with dearness allowance operating on a slab system would throw an impossible burden of about rs 1 crore on the financial capacity of the appellant \\nit was open to the tribunal to adopt the position which it did \\nif the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered \\nthe award is a composite document in which the several elements of increased wage scales larger increments longer span of 20 years for earning increments dearness allowance at 10 of the basic wage besides several other benefits have been integrated into a balanced arrangement in keeping with what the tribunal has found to be the financial capacity of the appellant \\nit is not possible to maintain one part of the award and supersede another \\naccordingly the appeal filed by the workmen must fail \\nin the result civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 is allowed in part insofar that the order dated 22nd december1978 of the industrial tribunal maharashtra bombay is quashed to the extent that it modifies the original award dated 20th december1978and the corrigendum made consequent thereto is also quashed \\ncivil appeal no 2300 of 1979 is dismissed \\nthere is no order as to costs \\nchinnappa reddy j we have had the advantage of perusing the judgment prepared by our learned brother pathak j we agree with him that civil appeal no 2300 of 1979 should be dismissed \\nwe also agree with him that civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 should also be dismissed in so far as it relates to the award dated december 201978 however we do not agree with our learned brother that civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 should be allowed in so far as it relates to the order dated december 221978 of the industrial tribunal which purports to correct the award dated december 201978 in our opinion civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 should be dismissed in its entirety \\nwe do not propose to give our reasons to the extent we are in agreement with pathak j and we propose to state our reasons for the disagreement only \\nit is needless to recapitulate all the basic facts which have been set out in the judgment of pathak j the award of the industrial tribunal was made on december 201978 on december 221978 that is to say two days after the award was made and when everything must have been fresh to the minds of the tribunal the respective parties and their advocates the employees union made an application under rule 31 of the industrial disputes bombay rules1957 seeking a correction of an error which it was claimed had crept into the award \\nthe application was as follows in the above reference your honour was pleased to pass an award on 20th december1978 \\nin the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance \\nfurther it appears that the tribunal intended to grant the increase of rs 150 to each draughtsman and rs 100 to all other workmen in their basic pay \\nthe union therefore prays the honourable tribunal to clarify the position and correct the award accordingly \\non this application the advocate for the employer company made the following endorsement submitted to whatever this honourable tribunal desires to do \\nthereafter the tribunal made an order on the same day in the following terms there can be no doubt that a flat increase of rs 150 to each of the employees in the category of draftsmen and of rs 100 to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award \\nthis order was made in the presence of shri manak gagrat advocate for the company and shri n p mehta advocate for the workmen \\nthe endorsement made on the application by the advocate for the company does not indicate that the company had any objection to the award being corrected as sought by the employees union \\non the other hand the endorsement reads as if there was tacit agreement on the part of the company to the correction sought by the union \\nthe order dated december 221978 of the tribunal also does not reveal that there was any opposition by the company to the application for correcting the award \\neven so we propose to examine whether the correction sought by the employees union was within the bounds of the authority of the tribunal or whether it was in effect a fresh award \\nthe primary and basic question considered by the industrial tribunal in making the award dated december 201978 was the question of revision of the wage scales \\nimplicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage scales and flat or ad hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary \\nit can not possibly be doubted that an industrial tribunal deciding upon the wage scales of the employees of an establishment would have full liberty to propose ad hoc increase of salaries as part of the revision of wages \\nnor can it be doubted that fitment into the revised pay scales is certainly a part of the revision of pay scales \\nthis in our opinion is elementary and fundamental to the jurisdiction of the industrial tribunal in revising wage scales \\nin the present case the industrial tribunal on a consideration of the material placed before it came to the conclusion that the company was in an undoubted position to bear the additional financial burden \\nat the end of paragraph 15 of the award the tribunal stated but there can be no doubt that the company can very well bear the additional burden \\nthe question is what should be the extent of such burden \\nat the end of paragraph 18 of the award the tribunal said a mere reading of exhibit u 15 will immediately dispel the misgivings about the future of the present company \\nfor some years to come this is likely to be one of the few consulting engineers who will be securing major contracts \\nagain in paragraph 19 it was said i have no doubt that the present company would be able to bear the additional burden for the years to come \\nthis is further borne out from the trading results of the company for the year 1968 69 to 1977 the profits have increased all along \\nthe copy of the letter dated july 231973alongwith \\nthe annexures from the company to the director general posts telegraphs delhi ex \\nc 27 indicates the important projects the company was handling in india and abroad and the amount of foreign exchange earned and repatriated \\ni will therefore proceed on the ground that the present company can bear the additional financial burden \\nfinally at the end of paragraph 21 \\nthe tribunal said in view of this position the company can easily bear some burden that might fall as a result of the upward revision of the wage scales \\nthe question is to what extent the relief should be given to the employees \\nafter expressing himself in categoric terms about the capacity of the company to bear the additional financial burden the tribunal went on to say i only propose to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category \\nthe tribunal then considered the question whether draftsmen should get a higher flat increase and the question whether the existing scheme of dearness allowance should be revised \\nthe tribunal then observed the flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draftsmen and rs 100 in the case of the other categories would be fair \\nthereafter various other matters were considered and finally the tribunal revised the wage scales in the manner already mentioned by my brother pathak j the question of fitment was then considered in the following manner fitment if as on 1st january1976an employee is drawing a salary less than the beginning of the respective grade he should be first stepped up to the beginning of the grade \\nif the pay of an employee does not coincide with any step in the revised pay scale and falls between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay of that employee shall be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale \\nafter fixing the salary of the employees in the scales as above the employees should be given increments in the new scales as noted below i employees who have completed 5 years or more as on 1st january19763 increments \\nii employees who have completed 4 years of service as on 1st january19762 increments \\nall other employees with more than one year  s service shall be given one increment \\nnow if without any flat or ad hoc increase of salary the workmen were to be fitted into the revised scales of pay it would obviously result in serious anomalous situations \\nin the case of several senior employees the revised scale would yield but a very small and almost a token increase in the size of the pay packet whereas the junior employees would get a large benefit \\nwhile workmen raising industrial disputes for revision of wage scales are certainly minded about their future prospects in the matter of wages they surely would be more concerned with the immediate benefits according to them \\nthat was why the industrial tribunal thought that an all round flat increase of rs 150 in the case of draftsmen and rs 100 in the case of other workmen was called for \\nit was clearly so intended by the tribunal as is evident from the reference to flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draftsmen and rs 100 in the case of the other categories \\nsince there was to be a flat increase of rs 150 and rs 100 in the case of draftsmen and other workmen respectively the revised wage scale had necessarily to commence with figures rs 150 and rs 100 above the existing wage scales \\nimmediately after the award was pronounced while the iron was still hot as it were the employees apparently realised that the employer might take advantage of the circumstance that it was not clearly mentioned in the award that all the employees were to get additional pay of rs 150 and rs 100 respectively and might contend that the tribunal had only revised the wage scales by increasing the salary on entry into the service and restructuring the scale of pay and never granted any ad hoc increase of salary to all employees \\ntherefore they filed an application before the tribunal for correcting the award so as to bring out what was intended \\nas it has now turned out what the employees apparently suspected the employer might contend is precisely what the employer is not contending though the employer did not choose to so contend before the industrial tribunal itself when the employees filed the application for rectification \\nthe application before the tribunal was filed under rule 31 of the bombay industrial disputes rules 1957which is as follows \\na board court labour court tribunal or arbitrator may at any time suo moto or on an application made by any of the parties concerned may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any proceedings report award or as the case may be decision \\nthe omission of the words to each employee first after the figure rs 150 and again after the figure rs 100 was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the tribunal was entitled to correct \\nwe are unable to see how it can be held to be otherwise \\nwe are not impressed with the submission of the learned counsel for the company that the corrigendum was in effect a fresh award \\nwe therefore see no ground for quashing the order dated december 221978 of the tribunal \\nthe result of the foregoing discussion is that civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 has to be dismissed in its entirety \\nwe have already indicated that we agree with our brother pathak j that the appeal civil appeal no 2300 of 1979 filed by the workmen should also be dismissed \\nwhile we find lot of force in the submission of shri v m tarkunde learned counsel for the workmen that dearness allowance linked to cost of living index is ordinarily the best and the most scientific method of computing dearness allowance it can not always be said that an illegality warranting interference under article 136 is committed if some other method is adopted \\nthe tribunal has given satisfactory reason for adopting a different mode and we are not disposed to interfere with the award of the tribunal \\nin the result both the appeals are dismissed without any order as to costs \\nthe order of the court was as follows \\nin view of the opinion of the majority both the appeals are dismissed and there is no order as to costs \\n\",\n          \"ujjagar singh the appellant herein a resident of village bangawali tehsil malerkotla was tried and convicted by the additional sessions judge sangrur for the murder of his niece mukhtiar kaur and was awarded the death penalty \\nin addition he was convicted for an offence punishable section 376 of the ipc and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to a fine of rs 5 000 and in default of payment to undergo further r i for one year and section 309 of the ipc to a sentence of simple imprisonment for one year \\nthe aforesaid convictions and sentences have been maintained by the high court and the matter is before us in these proceedings by way of special leave \\nthe facts of the case are as under \\nat about 2 00 p m on 10th november 2002 a boy whose identity is not forthcoming informed satnam singh pw2 that an incident of firing had taken place in the house of ujjagar singh situated in the fields on the outskirts of the village \\nsatnam singh conveyed this information to sarpanch jora singh pw1 who was attending a marriage at that time \\njora singh accompanied by gurdeep singh pw3 thereupon rushed to ujjagar singh  s house and found mukhtiar kaur lying dead with a gun shot injury and the appellant also with a gun shot injury lying unconscious on the ground in the adjoining room \\njora singh and gurdeep singh immediately removed ujjagar singh to the civil hospital dhuri in the jeep belonging to kulwant singh pw4 \\njora singh also met inspector harjinder pal singh pw14 at 4 40 p m near the hospital who recorded his statement at that place and with his endorsement exhibit p a sent it to police station dhuri where the formal fir was registered at about 4 45 p m with the special report being delivered to the illaka magistrate at dhuri itself at 6 20 p m the same evening \\nthe facts as narrated were that arjan singh of village bangawali had three sons puran singh ujjagar singh appellant and ajmer singh \\npuran singh had died about 20 years earlier leaving behind his wife two sons and a daughter mukhtiar kaur \\nthe two sons and the wife also died long before the incident and mukhtiar kaur the sole surviving member of this branch of the family had been married to balwinder singh pw9 about 9 or 10 years earlier \\npuran singh had however transferred 30 or 35 bighas of agricultural land falling to his share after the death of his father in the name of the appellant  s sons by a collusive decree in the year 1994 and the suggestion was that this transaction had been objected to by mukhtiar kaur who was demanding that the land be returned to her \\nit appears that mukhtiar kaur  s relations with her in laws had got strained and she had left her matrimonial home and come to live with ujjagar singh her uncle 7 or 8 months earlier and the suggestion was that mukhtiar kaur had been killed by the appellant with his licensed gun and he had thereafter attempted to commit suicide \\nhaving recorded the aforesaid facts in the fir pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh reached the place of incident and lifted one spent 12 bore cartridge case shaktiman make from near mukhtiar kaur  s dead body and one dbbl gun from the place where ujjagar singh appeared to have been shot and another spent cartridge case was recovered from the right barrel of the gun \\nafter completion of the investigation at the spot mukhtiar kaur  s dead body was sent for its post mortem examination \\nthe post mortem examination was also conducted by pw5 dr ishwar singh medical officer civil hospital along with dr harwinder kaur pw17 and it was found that mukhtiar kaur had two gunshot injuries on her dead body a wound of entry on the back of right side of chest 2 cm x 1 cm with margining and blackening and a corresponding exit wound of 5 cm x 3 5 cm to the front of the right side of the chest \\ndr harwinder kaur aforesaid also took swabs from the vagina of the deceased and as per the chemical examiner  s report dated 2 1 2003 semen was found on the swab taken from the vagina and from the underwear that mukhtiar kaur had been wearing at the time of her death \\nthe weapon and the recovered cartridge cases had also been sent to the forensic science laboratory which in its report dated 4 8 2004 opined that the crime cartridge case ci could have been fired by the right barrel of the weapon whereas the crime cartridge case c2 had been fired from the right barrel \\non the completion of the investigation a charge sheet under sections 302 376 and 309 of the ipc was filed against the accused and as he pleaded not guilty he was brought to trial \\nduring the trial jora singh pw1 satnam singh pw2 gurdeep singh pw3 and kulwant singh pw4 resiled from their statements given to the police and were declared hostile \\nbalwinder singh pw9 however supported the prosecution case deposing that the land had in fact been got transferred from gurmail kaur mother of mukhtiar kaur to ujjagar singh by fraud and mukhtiar kaur was therefore entitled to its return \\nhe also deposed that mukhtiar kaur had told him some time earlier that the accused had been beating her and had also committed sexual intercourse with her and that at about 11 p m on 10 11 2002 karam singh pw10 had informed him as to what had transpired on which he along with his father hamir singh pw12 and several others had rushed to bangawali \\npw10 karam singh aforesaid confirmed the story given by balwinder singh \\nthe prosecution also relied on the statements of dr vijay kumar pw6 of the civil hospial dhuri who testified that the appellant had been brought to the hospital at about 2 45 p m on 10 11 2002 with a serious gun shot injury dr ripan miglani pw15 of the dayanand medical college hospital ludhiana who deposed that he had been admitted to the department of neuro surgery with a serious gun shot injury and dr sanjay uppal pw16 a plastic surgeon who disclosed that the appellant had been under his treatment for almost 5 weeks and the burnt area around the firearm injury had been removed by him \\nthe prosecution also placed reliance on the statement of asi jasbir singh pw11 who had accompanied inspector harjinder pal singh pw14 to the place of incident and supported the recoveries made from the spot \\nthe prosecution case was then put to the accused and his statement recorded section \\n313 of the cr \\np c in reply to question 33 he stated as under i am innocent \\ni have been implicated falsely in this case \\ni was treating mukhtiar kaur as my daughter and loved her as my daughter \\nfalse allegations have been levelled against me \\ni never harassed mukhtiar kaur nor ever got her land mutated from her mother by fraud \\ni have not killed mukhtiar kaur \\nmother of mukhtiar kaur got the land mutated by her own free will and mukhtiar kaur had no dispute about it \\nbalwinder singh her husband was addicted to vices and used to beat her due to which she used to remain under depression and sick generally and used to come to me as my daughter \\nmy house kothi is situated on the outer skirts of village bangawali and door planks had not been fixed so far to rooms \\nsome body suddenly came and fired at me \\ni fell down on the ground and became unconscious \\ntherefore i could not see what had happened to mukhtiar kaur as she was in other room \\nlater on i came to know that some body had fired at her and she died \\ni regained consciousness in hospital \\nthe story of rape by me with her has been fabricated by her husband as he is inimical towards me \\neven i do not know who took me to hospital \\ni have been implicated in this case falsely \\nthe trial court and the high court relying on the circumstances available on the evidence convicted and sentenced the appellant as already mentioned above \\nmr goburdhan the learned counsel for the accused has raised several arguments in the course of hearing \\nhe has pointed out that there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that mukhtiar kaur had been subjected to rape and in this view of the matter the very basis for the imposition of the death penalty was not made out \\nhe has also pointed out that there were no eye witnesses to the incident and the 4 witnesses i e jora singh and others who had reached the place of incident and carried the injured appellant to the hospital had also resiled and as the prosecution story now rested on circumstantial evidence alone it was imperative for the investigating officer to have taken the finger prints from the weapon and that in any case the recovery of the spent cartridges and the gun were clearly suspicious as the weapon had been sent to the laboratory after an inordinate delay \\nit has also been submitted that in a case of attempted suicide a firearm must of necessity be used from a very close range and the absence of any blackening charring or burning around the wound on ujjagar singh clearly ruled out the possibility of such an attempt \\nit has finally been submitted that the land had been transferred in the name of ujjagar singh  s sons in the year 1994 by gurmail kaur mother of mukhtiar kaur by a collusive decree and there was no evidence to show that mukhtiar kaur had ever displayed any unhappiness or made any complaint to any person or any authority with regard to the decree and as such the very basis of the prosecution story did not exist \\nthe learned state counsel has however supported the judgment of the courts below \\nhe has further emphasized that the prosecution  s case stood proved from various factors including the medical evidence the reports of the forensic science laboratory the chemical examiner from the post mortem reports and the recovery of the gun and cartridges \\nwe have heard the learned counsel for the parties and gone through the record \\nwe first take up for consideration the question of the conviction section 376 of the ipc \\nwe find from the medical evidence and from the chemical examiner  s reports that the vaginal swab and clothes taken from the dead body did indicate the presence of semen \\nthere is however absolutely no evidence to suggest even assuming that the intercourse had been committed by the appellant that he had done so without mukhtiar kaur  s consent or against her will \\nsome suspicions of rape could perhaps have been raised had some tell tale injuries been detected on mukhtiar kaur  s person but we find that the two injuries other than the gun shot wounds i e injury no 3 being on the left pinna and \\nno 4 an abrasion near the right eye do not indicate any attempt to rape or the commission of rape \\nit is also significant that the investigators had made no attempt whatsoever to have the appellant medically examined to ascertain his capacity to perform sexual intercourse \\nthe learned state counsel relying on the statement of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh has however submitted that the examination had not been possible as the appellant had received a very serious gun shot injury and was hanging between life and death \\nwe agree with the submission of the learned counsel that an examination could not have been carried out immediately \\nbut we see no justification in the omission of the prosecution to have him examined after he had recovered his health and been discharged from hospital \\nwe are further of the opinion that even assuming for a moment that sexual intercourse between the two had indeed taken place it can not be said from the evidence before us that it was without the consent or against the wishes of mukhtiar kaur \\nwe therefore find that ujjagar singh  s conviction section 376 of the ipc can not be sustained \\nmr goburdhan has placed great emphasis on the fact that as the four witnesses who had reached the place of incident i e jora singh satnam singh gurdeep singh and kulwant singh had resiled from their statements and had disowned their initial stories the prosecution had of necessity to rely on circumstantial evidence and if the chain of circumstances remained incomplete or even if one link in the chain was broken the prosecution must fail \\nhe has also relied on the judgment of balu sonba shinde v state of maharashtra 2002 7 scc 543 2002 indlaw sc 1923 to contend that it was open to the accused to take advantage insofar as possible from the statement of a witness though declared hostile and the four witnesses having disowned the prosecution story and having given a different version the appellant was entitled to derive such benefit as possible in this situation \\nthe learned state counsel has however emphasized that both the trial court and the high court had for good reasons opined that the circumstances made out a case for conviction and the accused having given a counter version some obligation lay on him as well to explain the circumstances against him inasmuch that admittedly he and the victim were alone in the house at the time of the incident \\nreliance for this argument has been placed on the decision of raj kumar prasad tamarkar v state of bihar anr 20071 \\nscale 19 2007 indlaw sc 5 \\nwe have considered their arguments very carefully \\nin mahmood v state of u p 1976 1 scc 542 1975 indlaw sc 643 it has been observed that in a case dependent wholly on circumstantial evidence the court must be satisfied athat the circumstances from which the inference of guilt is to be drawn have been fully established by unimpeachable evidence beyond a shadow of doubt bthat the circumstances are of a determinative tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused and cthat the circumstances taken collectively are incapable of explanation on any reasonable hypothesis save that of the guilt sought to be proved against him \\nin this case this court held that the omission of the prosecution inter alia to have the finger prints found on the alleged murder weapon was fatal to the prosecution story \\nin 1984 4 scc 116 sharad birdhichand sarda v state of maharashtra 1984 indlaw sc 432 this court discussed the ratio of the judgments in hanumant v state of m p air 1952 sc 343

maharashtra 1973 2 scc 793 1973 indlaw sc 181 and observed thus a close analysis of this decision would show that the following conditions must be fulfilled before a case against an accused can be said to be fully established 1the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established \\nit may be noted here that this court indicated that the circumstances concerned must or should and not may be established \\nthere is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between may be proved and must be or should be proved as was held by this court in shivaji sahabrao bobade v state of maharashtra 1973 indlaw sc 181 where the following observations were made \\ncertainly it is a primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and the mental distance between may be is long and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions \\n2the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused that is to say they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty 3the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency 4they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved and 5there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused \\nmr goburdhan has also cited mahmood v state of u p 1976 1 scc 542 1975 indlaw sc 643 shankarlal gyarasilal dixit v state of maharashtra 1981 2 scc 35 1980 indlaw sc 47 sharad birdhichand sarda v state of maharashtra 1984 4 scc 116 1984 indlaw sc 432 omwati smt and

sc 144 in support of his plea relating to the evaluation of circumstantial evidence \\nthese judgments have broadly followed the principles laid down in the judgments referred to above and need not therefore be dealt with us in extenso \\nit must nonetheless be emphasized that whether a chain is complete or not would depend on the facts of each case emanating from the evidence and no universal yardstick should ever be attempted \\nit is in this background that we must examine the circumstances in the present case \\na few facts stand out from the prosecution story \\nfirst the place of incident being adjoining rooms in the residential house of the appellant and the fact that the alleged murder weapon is his licensed dbbl gun is proved on record \\nthe evidence also reveals that the appellant was living in the premises along with his wife mother and son and two daughters who were studying outside the village were frequent visitors but it is the admitted position that nobody but the appellant and the deceased were present at the time of incident \\nit is also clear from the evidence that the two spent cartridge cases recovered one from near mukhtiar kaur  s dead body and the second from the right barrel of the gun lying near the appellant had been sent to the forensic science laboratory which opined that one of the cartridges had been fired from the gun and the other could have been fired therefrom \\nmr goburdhan has however laid great emphasis on the fact that no reference to the gun or cartridges had been made in the inquest report and that in any case the weapon and the spent cartridges had been sent to the laboratory belatedly \\nwe are of the opinion however that no adverse inference can be drawn from either of these circumstances \\nthe aforesaid articles had been carried to the laboratory by constable gopal singh who in his affidavit dated 17th march 2003 deposed that he had first taken the articles to the laboratory on 9th december 2002 but they had been returned by the director on the ground that the seals affixed thereon were not of the requisite number and that after removing the objections raised by the director the articles aforesaid had been returned to the laboratory on 18th december 2002 \\ngopal singh was cross examined by the prosecution \\nand but for some inconsequential questions put to him with regard to the seals not even a suggestion was made that the aforesaid articles had in any way been tampered with \\nit is true as contended that in column 22 of the inquest report which refers to the articles found near the dead body there is no reference to the spent cartridges or the murder weapon but we find from a perusal of the site plan exh \\npjj prepared by the investigating officer inspector harjinder pal singh pw14 on 10th november 2002 that the weapon is shown lying close to the place where the appellant had been found unconscious and a spent cartridge recovered from near the dead body of mukhtiar kaur \\nit has also been submitted by mr goburdhan that there appeared to be no motive for the incident as the story about mukhtiar kaur  s unhappiness about the transfer of land to the sons of ujjagar singh sought to be proved by pw9 balwinder singh and pw10 karam singh had been disbelieved by the high court with the observation that the statements of these two witnesses could not be relied upon \\nit is true that in a case relating to circumstantial evidence motive does assume great importance but to say that the absence of motive would dislodge the entire prosecution story is perhaps giving this one factor an importance which is not due and to use the clichi \\nthe motive is in the mind of the accused and can seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy \\nthere is however a hint in the testimony of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh that his enquiries had revealed that the accused was having illicit relations with mukhtiar kaur and we can assume that some thing untoward had happened which could have triggered the volatile and hostile incident \\nthere could perhaps be some truth in this suggestion as it is significant that though the appellant had an extended family living with him i e mother wife son living in the village and two young daughters who were studying outside and residing in a hostel but were frequent visitors home yet none of them has come forth to depose in his favour \\nto our mind therefore this is yet another circumstance inculpating the accused \\nmr goburdhan has also laid much stress on the apparent discordance between the prosecution story and the medical evidence and has argued that had the accused attempted to commit suicide the gun shot must of necessity had to be fired from a very close range on which the wound would have marks of burning or charring and that in any event a full blooded shot from a very close range would have torn his face apart \\nhe has in this connection referred us to the statement of dr ripan miglani pw15 and the wound found on the appellant at the time of his medical examination in the department of surgery of the dayanand medical college hospital ludhiana which was about 15 x 8 cm curvilinear wound present on the left half of face extending upto bone \\nno blackening or foreign body was visible \\nunderlying muscles were exposed and contamination was present \\nhe has thus urged that the absence of any blackening underlined the argument that the shot had been fired from some distance and as such an attempt at suicide was clearly to be ruled out \\nhe has also drawn our attention to the cross examination of the doctor wherein he reiterated that there was no visible blackening and that it was not possible for him to say whether the injury was suicidal or otherwise \\nthe learned state counsel has however relied on the statement of pw16 dr sanjay uppal who was apparently the first doctor to have examined the appellant wherein he clearly testified that the blackened portion around the firearm injury had been removed by him \\nwe are therefore of the opinion that this statement falsifies mr goburdhan  s argument on this aspect \\nit is also significant that the shot had apparently travelled upwards skirting the mandible through the flesh of the cheek in an upward direction with minimal damage to the bone structure and it is indeed providential that the appellant got away with only an injury albeit a very serious one \\nthe fact that the shot was fired from below going upwards is also supported by the site plan exh \\npjj wherein marks of a shot hitting the roof were seen at point e whereas the appellant was found lying at point d in the same room \\nit is therefore apparent that the weapon had indeed been fired by the appellant from a close range and that the blackened portion around the wound had been removed by dr sanjay uppal \\nthe learned state counsel has emphasized that in the light of the admitted position that the accused and the deceased were the only ones present at the time of incident and that the accused had projected a counter story some credible explanation was also expected from him \\nreference has been made to raj kumar prasad tamarkar  s case2007 indlaw sc 5 supra wherein in circumstances surprisingly akin to the present matter this court had the following observations to make the conspectus of the events which had been noticed by the learned sessions judge as also by the high court categorically go to show that at the time when the occurrence took place the deceased and the respondent only were in the bedroom and the terrace connecting the same \\nthere was no other person \\nthe cause of death of the deceased usha devi i e by a gun shot injury is not disputed \\nthe fact that the terrace and the bedroom are adjoining each other is not in dispute \\nthe autopsy report shows that a blackening and charring existed so far as injury no i is concerned \\nthe blackening and charring keeping in view the nature of the firearm which is said to have been used clearly go to show that a shot was fired from a short distance \\nblackening or charring is possible when a shot is fired from a distance of about 2 feet to 3 feet \\nit therefore can not be a case where the death might have been caused by somebody by firing a shot at the deceased from a distance of more than 6 feet \\nthe place of injury is also important \\nthe lacerated wound was found over grabella middle of forehead \\nit goes a long way to show that the same must have been done by a person who wanted to kill the deceased from a short distance \\nthere was thus a remote possibility of causation of such type of injury by any other person who was not in the terrace \\nonce the prosecution has been able to show that at the relevant time the room and terrace were in exclusive occupation of the couple the burden of proof lay upon the respondent to show under what circumstances death was caused to his wife \\nthe onus was on him \\nhe failed to discharge the same \\nwe have considered the submission of the state counsel very carefully \\nit is true that it is generally for the prosecution to prove its case beyond doubt but in circumstances such as the present one some explanation is also due from an accused in order to absolve himself from suspicion of the crime \\nin his statement section p c his positive stand was that he alone had been in the house with mukhtiar kaur when she had been killed and indeed as per exhibit p jj mukhtiar kaur  s body had been found only one karam 5 feet away from the place where the appellant lay injured \\nit must be emphasized that but for this self serving statement made by the appellant there is nothing on record to support his positive stance \\neven otherwise we are of the opinion that had the shot been fired by some intruder the direction would have been more or less horizontal and parallel to the ground and not from down upwards with the pellets hitting the jaw skirting the cheek and hitting the roof at point \\ne in modi  s medical jurisprudence and toxicology 23rd edition at page 765 while dealing with identification of homicidal and suicidal injuries it has been observed that a suicidal firearm wound is usually a contact wound situated on the side of the temple depending on which hand was used to shoot himself in the centre of the forehead the roof of the mouth in the chest or epigastrium in front or the left side and some times under the chin \\nthe firearm is usually fired at close range \\na small weapon like a revolver or a pistol is held in the hand while a rifle or a shot gun is supported on the ground or against the wall \\nsometimes the firing is done by pulling a string tied to the trigger by the big toe \\nthe skin around the entry wound shows characteristic blackening scorching and tattooing \\nin such cases the hand used to steady the weapon at the muzzle may be blackened and scorched and may also be stained with squirting of the blood from the injured arteries \\nin homicidal and accidental shooting the wound may be on any part of the body and the path of the bullet may be in any direction \\nhomicidal shooting by dacoits is not uncommon in india and they are known to make their own firearms \\nimmediate death following a firearm wound is uncommon and even when vital organs are injured a person may be capable of doing extraordinary things \\nsometimes firearm wounds may look like knife slashes or a bullet hole may resemble a penetrating stab wound if the bullet strikes the head of shoulder at an angle or when an unstable bullet registers a broadside hit \\na fateh describes a rare homicidal gun shot wound of the mouth where the entry wound was in the tongue and the direction was horizontally backward while in suicidal wounds the direction is upwards entrance would be in the palate or posterior pharynx \\ndr b r sharma in his book forensic science in criminal investigation and trials fourth edition at page 1160 too has delineated the circumstances that could indicate suicide and while referring to the site of the injury has observed certain sites are predominantly used by suicides for self inflicted injuries \\nfor example with firearm temple forehead mouth and chest are the favourite sites \\nwith knife throat and wrist are the favourite sites \\nhesitation injuries are also observed in some suicide cases \\nit is therefore clear to us that the story of unknown assailants entering the house and causing mukhtiar kaur  s murder etcetera has to be ruled out and that the prosecution story that it was the appellant who had first shot mukhtiar kaur and then attempted to commit suicide stands proved \\nwe also find that no part of the evidence of the hostile witnesses comes to the aid of the appellant \\nthe question now arises as to the sentence that should be imposed on the appellant \\nit would be seen that both the sessions court and the high court were appalled by the allegations and findings of incestuous rape and murder \\nwe are however of the opinion as already noted above that a case of rape has not been made out \\nin this background the death sentence is not called for \\nwe accordingly acquit the appellant of the charge section 376 of the ipc but maintain his conviction for the other offences but commute his death sentence to life \\nwith this modification the appeal is dismissed \\nappeal dismissed \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"expected_output\",\n

that behalf a legal notice was issued upon it questioning its right to use the said mark in respect of centrifugal pumps by the appellant laying a claim that it had been using the said mark since 1963  respondent no 1 thereafter filed a suit in the delhi high court for grant of a decree of permanent injunction being suit no 2408 of 1985 alleging infringement of the said mark and or claiming right of passing off in respect thereof  an ex parte order of injunction was passed on 19 12 1985 against the defendant  meanwhile a temporary ex parte injunction is issued against the defendants

refused to stay the operation of the order of the board dated 27 10 2004 an appeal was preferred there against  the division bench of the high court thereafter while disposing of both the writ petition and the letters patent appeal allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of the board and directed it to adjudicate the dispute on merits  the said order of the division bench is under challenge in this appeal   argument appellant s counsel appeared on that date and inter alia contended that presently it was the registered owner of the trade mark which was sought to be cancelled  in view of that statement a submission was made on behalf of the first respondent that it may be permitted to withdraw the petition with liberty to file a fresh petition on the same cause of action   issue whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case the application under s 46 1  b  was maintainable  whether  to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps  goods  so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned   analysis the core question which arises for our consideration is as to whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case the application under s 46 1  b  was maintainable  indisputably the scope of the provisions for removal from register in terms of s 46 and 56 of the act stand on different footings  whereas s 46 had a limited application s 56 of the act is wider in nature  concededly cl  a  of sub s  1  of s 46 is not attracted in the case  the prayer in the application was to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps  goods  so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned  it is in the aforementioned situation it is advisable to determine the meaning of the words  for the time being  occurring in s 46 1  b  of the act  two interpretations thereto which are possible are   1  the said words would denote non use of the trade mark in relation to the goods by the appellant for a period of five years or longer  and  2  the mark had not been used for a period of five years or longer either by the present proprietor thereof or his predecessor  the words  for the time being  would mean differently in different situations  it may mean  the moment or existing position  as was held by this court in the case of jivendra nath kaul v  collector district magistrate and anr   1992  3 scc 576 1992 indlaw sc 1107  or in the context of cl  22  of art 366 of the constitution as has been

dies or ceases to be a ruler a successor shall be appointed and that there shall not be more rulers than one at a given time  the person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods as that of the registered owner  it confers an exclusive right of use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in which the trade mark is registered  whether s 46 1  b  read with s 48 of the act would bring within its purview not only a registered proprietor but also the proprietor who had otherwise acquired a right would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case  the court while construing a statute takes into consideration the parliamentary intent in amending the provisions thereof  it seeks to enhance the period of moratorium of use of the registered trade mark from one month to three months so as to prevent speculative assignment  thus a case of speculative assignment is specifically required to be made out  such an application may be maintainable in terms of s 56 of the act but strictly not in terms of s 46 1  b  thereof and that too in the absence of the original registered proprietor  attention has again been drawn to a passage from  law of trade marks    geographical indications  by shri k c kailasam wherein the judgment of the tribunal has been criticized in the following terms    from the above legislative intent it would seem that the period of non use of the trade mark is to be reckoned continuously from the date of its registration  in the case of american home products corporation v  mac laboratories pvt ltd  rendered under the 1958 act it was held by the supreme court that  the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the register has only to prove  such continuous non user   it would appear that neither the u k act nor the indian act at any time envisaged that the commencement of 5 year period of non use is to be delinked from the date of registration of the mark so as to give a fresh lease of life to the registration every time there is change in the ownership of the mark  if that be so any registered proprietor could easily defeat an application for rectification by assigning the mark to some other person to have a fresh period of 5 years from the date of assignment and thus effectively frustrate the very object of the provision in s 47 1  a  and  b   further it is to be noted that an assignment is subject to  the provisions of the act and any rights vested in any other person   see  s 37  the assignor cannot obviously transfer more rights than he himself has to the assignee under the act  an assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses   statute interpretation of the provisions of s 46 1  b   and section 48 of the trade and merchandise marks act 1958  \",\n          \"facts tata consultant engineers was a partnership firm but subsequently the partnership was dissolved and in 1974 the undertaking became one of the divisions of tata sons limited  it functions as a consulting organisation and a service industry and does not manufacture any product or carry on trade its work force consists of engineers and supervisors and different categories of workmen  the tata consultant employees union served a charter of demands in july 1974 on the appellant and as their demands were not accepted and conciliation proceedings proved fruitless the state government made a reference of the dispute under s 10 1  d  industrial tribunal maharashtra for adjudication  the union filed a statement before the tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments  it was urged that the efficiency bar as a feature of the wage scales should be removed  the dearness allowance it was claimed should be granted on a slab system  the claim of the union was resisted by the appellant who maintained that the existing wage scales were fair and reasonable on a region cum industry basis and that it would not be possible for the appellant to bear the additional financial burden if the demands of the union were accepted  the appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised  there was no separate dearness allowance until january 1977 when it was introduced for the first time  house rent allowance was also paid  dearness allowance became payable at 10  of the basic wage subject to a minimum of rs 50  and house rent allowance at 30  of the basic salary  the tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years there was definite need for revising the wage scales  it also laid down the principle enabling the actual fitment of the workmen in their respective wage scales as on that date and also provided for the number of increments to which they would be entitled having regard to the period of completed service  two days after the award was made an application was made by the union stating   in the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22 in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance   the workmen have filed an appeal by special leave  in which they have challenged the rejection by the tribunal of their claim in respect of dearness allowance which they contend should be pegged to the cost of living index and should not be a fixed amount   argument considering the appeal of tata consulting engineers first the contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal erred in making the wage scales retrospective and in any event in ranging the retrospectivity back to 1st january 1976  the learned counsel for the appellant had covered a wide field but in the end he states that the appellant is aggrieved by two matters only  one is the retrospectivity attached to the revised wage scales and the other is the flat increase given to each employee of rs 150  in the category of draughtsmen and rs 100  in other categories resulting from the order dated 22nd december 1978  it is urged that the amendment results in the inclusion of a flat increase of rs 150  to each workman in the case of draughtsman and rs 100  to each workman in the case of other categories a result wholly unwarranted it is said by the intent of the original award and therefore falling beyond the jurisdiction of the tribunal  the only contention of the workmen is that the tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index   issue the primary and basic question considered by the industrial tribunal in making the award dated december 20 1978 was the question of revision of the wage scales  implicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage scales and flat or ad hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary   analysis it must be remembered that although the wage scales were introduced as long ago as 1973 they were maintained at that level except for a slight revision some time thereafter  no dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time  the cost of living had gone on increasing from 1972 onwards and as the tribunal has found the dearness allowance and house rent allowance made no appreciable impact in neutralising the increasing cost  during all these years the appellant had continued to enjoy increasing profits  nonetheless the emoluments received by the workmen did not receive the impress of the appellant s growing prosperity  the charter of demands was presented by the union in july 1974 and when conciliation proceedings failed the state government made the reference to the industrial tribunal in 1975  they are considerations which cannot be ignored  accordingly the contention raised on behalf of the appellant against retrospectivity of the wage scales must be rejected  the financial capacity of the appellant and the related study of its annual profits from 1968 to 1977 were examined from that view point  the sufficiency of the existing pay scales was considered in detail and regard was had to their original structure and the accretions made subsequently by way of dearness allowance and house rent allowance  for the purpose of restructuring the pay scales the tribunal ruled on the paying capacity of the appellant both with reference to the profits of the preceding year as well as the prospects of the future  the financial capacity as the tribunal observed constituted one of  the principles which are required to be followed in the fixation of the wage structure   no ad hoc increase to the pay of each individual workman was intended  the jurisdiction given to the tribunal by rule 31 is closely circumscribed  it is only a clerical mistake or error which can be corrected and the clerical mistake or error must arise from an accidental slip or omission in the award  an accidental slip or omission implies that something was intended and contrary to that intention what should not have been included has been included or what should have been included has been omitted  it must be a mistake or error amenable to clerical correction only  it must not be a mistake or error which calls for rectification by modification of the conscious adjudication on the issues involved  the omission of the words to each employee first after the figure rs 150  and again after the figure rs 100  was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the tribunal was entitled to correct  it will be noted that the pay scales of different categories were being restructured and the flat increase envisaged there related to an increase in the general pay scales of different categories  individual workmen were not present to the mind of the tribunal  that the increase was pertinent to the general pay scales in the revised wage structure is patently clear from a comparison of the existing pay scales and the revised pay scales  the comparative table of existing pay scales and the revised pay scales has been reproduced earlier  the revised pay scales of all categories except the category of draughtsmen shows an increase of rs 100  in the initial pay fixed in each scale the increase in the case of the category of draughtsmen being rs 150   the amendment made by the tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase this time to each individual workmen  if as the tribunal has stated in the amendment order the increase in paragraph 23 was intended to apply to each individual workmen there is nothing in the body of the award to form the foundation on which the actual figures in the restructured pay scales can be made to rest  there will be no explanation why the initial start of the revised pay scales has been increased by rs 150  in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100  in the case of other categories  considering the fitment of the workman in the revised scales it was stated in the award that a workman found drawing a salary less than the beginning of the grade would be stepped up to the beginning of the grade and if his pay fell between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay was to be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale  reliance was placed on the hindustan times ltd  new delhi v their workmen  1964  1 scr 234 1962 indlaw sc 436 247 where it was observed by this court that dearness allowance should not remain fixed at any figure but should be on a sliding scale in order to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living  now it is not a universal rule that the dearness allowance should in all cases be correlated with the cost of living index  it was open to the tribunal to adopt the position which it did  if the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered  the award is a composite document in which the several elements of increased wage scales larger increments longer span of 20 years for earning increments dearness allowance at 10  of the basic wage besides several other benefits have been integrated into a balanced arrangement in keeping with what the tribunal has found to be the financial capacity of the appellant  it is not possible to maintain one part of the award and supersede another  conspicuous by its absence is any reference to a flat increase in the pay of an individual workmen  we are not impressed with the submission that the corrigendum was in effect a fresh award  we therefore see no ground for quashing the of the tribunal  dearness allowance linked to cost of living index is ordinarily the best and the most scientific method of computing dearness allowance it cannot always be said that an illegality warranting interference under article 136 is committed if some other method is adopted  the tribunal has given satisfactory reason for adopting a different mode and we are not disposed to interfere with the award of the tribunal   statute in making the application of 22nd december 1978 the union invoked the jurisdiction of the tribunal under rule 31 of the industrial disputes  bombay  rules 1957  rule 31 provides  the labour court tribunal or arbitrator may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any award it or he issues  the application before the tribunal was filed under rule 31 of the bombay industrial disputes rules 1957 which is as follows   a board court labour court tribunal or arbitrator may at any time suo moto or on an application made by any of the parties concerned may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any proceedings report award or as the case may be    \",\n          \"facts ujjagar singh  the appellant herein  was tried and convicted by the additional sessions judge  sangrur for the murder of his niece mukhtiar kaur and was awarded the death penalty  in addition  he was convicted for an offence punishable u s  376 of the ipc and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to a fine of rs 5  000   and in default of payment to undergo further r i  for one year and u s  309 of the ipc to a sentence of simple imprisonment for one year  the aforesaid convictions and sentences have been maintained by the high court and the matter is before us in these proceedings by way of special leave  at about 2 00 p m  on 10th november 2002 a boy whose identity is not forthcoming  informed satnam singh pw2 that an incident of firing had taken place in the house of ujjagar singh   satnam singh conveyed this information to sarpanch jora singh pw1 who was attending a marriage at that time  jora singh accompanied by gurdeep singh pw3 thereupon rushed to ujjagar singh s house and found mukhtiar kaur lying dead with a gun shot injury and the appellant also with a gun shot injury lying unconscious on the ground in the adjoining room  it appears that mukhtiar kaur s relations with her in laws had got strained and she had left her matrimonial home and come to live with ujjagar singh  her uncle  7 or 8 months earlier and the suggestion was that mukhtiar kaur had been killed by the appellant with his licensed gun and he had thereafter attempted to commit suicide   argument the learned counsel for the accused has raised several arguments in the course of hearing  he has pointed out that there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that mukhtiar kaur had been subjected to rape and in this view of the matter the very basis for the imposition of the death penalty was not made out  he has also pointed out that there were no eye witnesses to the incident and the 4 witnesses i e  jora singh and others who had reached the place of incident and carried the injured appellant to the hospital had also resiled and as the prosecution story now rested on circumstantial evidence alone  it was imperative for the investigating officer to have taken the finger prints from the weapon and that in any case the recovery of the spent cartridges and the gun were clearly suspicious as the weapon had been sent to the laboratory after an inordinate delay  it has also been submitted that in a case of attempted suicide a firearm must of necessity be used from a very close range and the absence of any blackening  charring or burning around the wound on ujjagar singh clearly ruled out the possibility of such an attempt  it has finally been submitted that the land had been transferred in the name of ujjagar singh s sons in the year 1994 by gurmail kaur  mother of mukhtiar kaur by a collusive decree and there was no evidence to show that mukhtiar kaur had ever displayed any unhappiness or made any complaint to any person or any authority with regard to the decree and as such  the very basis of the prosecution story did not exist  he had laid great emphasis on the fact that no reference to the gun or cartridges had been made in the inquest report and that in any case the weapon and the spent cartridges had been sent to the laboratory belatedly   issue convictions and sentences by the high court should be maintained or not   analysis from the medical evidence and from the chemical examiner s reports that the vaginal swab and clothes taken from the dead body did indicate the presence of semen  there is however absolutely no evidence to suggest  even assuming that the intercourse had been committed by the appellant  that he had done so without mukhtiar kaur s consent or against her will  it is also significant that the investigators had made no attempt whatsoever to have the appellant medically examined to ascertain his capacity to perform sexual intercourse  it must nonetheless be emphasized that whether a chain is complete or not would depend on the facts of each case emanating from the evidence and no universal yardstick should ever be attempted  it is in this background that we must examine the circumstances in the present case  a few facts stand out from the prosecution story  first  the place of incident being adjoining rooms in the residential house of the appellant and the fact that the alleged murder weapon is his licensed dbbl gun is proved on record  the evidence also reveals that the appellant was living in the premises along with his wife  mother and son  and two daughters  who were studying outside the village  were frequent visitors  but it is the admitted position that nobody but the appellant and the deceased were present at the time of incident  it is also clear from the evidence that the two spent cartridge cases recovered  one from near mukhtiar kaur s dead body  and the second from the right barrel of the gun lying near the appellant had been sent to the forensic science laboratory which opined that one of the cartridges had been fired from the gun and the other could have been fired therefrom  it is true that in a case relating to circumstantial evidence motive does assume great importance but to say that the absence of motive would dislodge the entire prosecution story is perhaps giving this one factor an importance which is not due and  to use the clichi  the motive is in the mind of the accused and can seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy  there is however a hint in the testimony of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh that his enquiries had revealed that the accused was having illicit relations with mukhtiar kaur and we can assume that some thing untoward had happened which could have triggered the volatile and hostile incident  there could perhaps be some truth in this suggestion  as it is significant that though the appellant had an extended family living with him i e  mother  wife  son living  in the village  and two young daughters who were studying outside and residing in a hostel  but were frequent visitors home  yet none of them has come forth to depose in his favour  therefore  this is yet another circumstance inculpating the accused  it is also significant that the shot had apparently travelled upwards skirting the mandible  through the flesh of the cheek in an upward direction with minimal damage to the bone structure and it is indeed providential that the appellant got away with only an injury  albeit a very serious one  the fact that the shot was fired from below going upwards is also supported by the site plan exh  pjj wherein marks of a shot hitting the roof were seen at point e whereas the appellant was found lying at point d in the same room  it is therefore apparent that the weapon had indeed been fired by the appellant from a close range and that the blackened portion around the wound had been removed by dr  sanjay uppal  it is true that it is generally for the prosecution to prove its case beyond doubt but in circumstances such as the present one  some explanation is also due from an accused in order to absolve himself from suspicion of the crime  no part of the evidence of the hostile witnesses comes to the aid of the appellant  the question now arises as to the sentence that should be imposed on the appellant  it would be seen that both the sessions court and the high court were appalled by the allegations and findings of incestuous rape and murder  we are however of the opinion  as already noted above  that a case of rape has not been made out  in this background the death sentence is not called for   statute section 376  309 of ipc  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

accordingly filed as withdrawn leaving the parties to bear their own costs \\na fresh application was filed by the first respondent \\nthe said m s jain industries however was not impleaded as a party therein \\nthe cause of action therefor was stated to have arisen in the following circumstances that the cause of action for the present petition arose in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents in the month of january 1987 when the respondent informed this honourable court that they have been recorded as subsequent proprietors of the impugned registered trade mark no 228867 in class 7 in c o no 9 of 1986whereupon the petitioner withdrew the said earlier petition c o no 9 of 1986 with permission of the court to file the present petition because of the changed circumstances

subject to the following conditions a defendants will not use the logo style of the word field marshal of which logo and style the plaintiff is the proprietor under the copyright act \\nb defendants shall mention the name of the defendant firm thukral mechanical works sirhind on each and every centrifugal pump manufactured by them and sold in the name of field marshal \\nc the defendants shall maintain proper accounts of the sale of centrifugal pumps under the trade mark field marshal and shall file them in court as and when directed \\ncorrectness or otherwise of the said order has not been questioned \\nthe second rectification application filed by the first respondent however was transferred to the intellectual property appellate board \\nthe said application was dismissed \\na writ petition was filed there against by the first respondent \\na learned single judge of the delhi high court however refused to stay the operation of the order of the board dated 27 10 2004 an appeal was preferred there against \\nthe division bench of the high court thereafter while disposing of both the writ petition and the letters patent appeal allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of the board and directed it to adjudicate the dispute on merits \\nthe said order of the division bench is under challenge in this appeal \\nthe core question which arises for our consideration is as to whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case the application under s 461b was maintainable \\nbefore adverting thereto we may take notice of the relevant statutory provisions ss 461b481482 and 56 read as under section 46 removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non use  1 subject to the provisions of section 47a registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application made in the prescribed manner to a high court or to the registrar by any person aggrieved on the ground either a b that up to a date one month before the date of the application a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being provided that except where the applicant has been permitted under sub s 3 of s 12 to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of the goods in question or where the tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark the tribunal may refuse an application u cl a or cl b in relation to any goods if it is shown that there has been before the relevent date or during the relevant period as the case may be bona fide use of the trade mark by any proprietor thereof for the time being in relation to goods of the same description being goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered \\nsection 48 registered users  1 subject to the provisions of section 49a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as the registered user thereof in respect of any or all of the goods in respect of which the trademark is registered otherwise than as a defensive trade mark but the central government may by rules made in this behalf provide that no application for registration as such shall be enertained unless the agreement between the parties complies with the conditions laid down in the rules for preventing trafficking in trade marks \\nthe permitted use of a trade mark shall be deemed to be used by the proprietor thereof and shall be deemed not to be used by a person other than the proprietor for the purposes of s 46 or for any other purpose for which such use is material under this act or any other law \\nsection 56 power to cancel or vary registration and to rectify the register  1 \\non application made in the prescribed manner to a high court or to the registrar by any person aggrieved the tribunal may make such order as it may think fit for cancelling or varying the registration of a trade mark on the ground of any contravention or failure to observe a condition entered on the register in relation thereto \\nany person aggrieved by the absence or omission from the register of any entry or by any entry made in the register without sufficient cause or by any entry wrongly remaining on the register or by any error of defect in any entry in the register may apply in the prescribed manner to a high court or to the registrar and the tribunal may make such order for making expunging or varying the entry as it may think fit \\nthe tribunal may in any proceeding under this section decide any question that may be necessary or expedient to decide in connection with the rectification of the register \\nthe tribunal of its own motion may after giving notice in the prescribed manner to the parties concerned and after giving them an opportunity of being heard make any order referred to in sub s 1 or sub s 2 \\nany order of the high court rectifying the register shall direct that notice of the rectification shall be served upon the registrar in the prescribed manner who shall upon receipt of such notice rectify the register accordingly \\nthe power to rectify the register conferred by this section shall include the power to remove a trade mark registered in part a of the register to part b of the register \\nindisputably the scope of the provisions for removal from register in terms of s 46 and 56 of the act stand on different footings \\nwhereas s 46 had a limited application s 56 of the act is wider in nature \\nconcededly cl a of sub s 1 of s 46 is not attracted in the case \\nfor the purpose of appreciation of the rival contentions we may notice the findings of the board as also the high court \\nthe board has taken the view that the period of five years and one month will begin to run from the date on which thukral became the proprietor of the trademark that is30th may1986 and therefore the rectification application could have been filed by the appellant only sometime in 1991 opining that an application for

other hand opined it was not anybody  s case before us that m s jain industries \\nthe registered proprietor of the trademark used it at all \\nthe trademark was used by the appellant and thukral neither of whom were proprietors thereof except that thukral claims to have become its proprietor with effect from 30th may1986 according to learned counsel for the appellant the use of the trademark by thukral was not legally permissible use inasmuch as thukral did not have the consent tacit or otherwise of m s jain industries to use the trademark \\nif thukral did then it can not be said that there was no bona fide use thereof by its proprietor \\nthat is m s jain industries \\nthis appears to be the position at least till 30th may1986 in \\nthe meantime as a result of the ex parte ad

appellant for a period of five years or longer and 2 the mark had not been used for a period of five years or longer either by the present proprietor thereof or his predecessor \\nwe may however also notice that another construction of the said provision has been put forth by mr sunderam learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that the word proprietor would not mean a registered proprietor but also a person who has become proprietor by long use thereof \\nthe words for the time being would mean differently in different situations \\nit may mean the moment or

dispute that the registration of a trade mark confers a very valuable right \\nthe person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods

right of a registered proprietor \\nit therefore can be taken away only when the conditions laid down therefor are satisfied \\nwhile we say so we are not oblivious of the fact that trafficking in

camouflage \\nif the assignee has obtained assignment for bona fide use he may not be fastened with any liability owing to non user on the part of his predecessor \\nin other words the mistake of the predecessor should not be visited with non use of the present registered owner \\nit must however be observed that whether a use is for bona fide purpose would essentially be a question of fact \\nwhether s 461b read with s 48 of the act would bring within its purview not only a registered proprietor but also the proprietor who had otherwise acquired a right would depend upon the facts and

years \\nfor the purpose of making out such a case both the original registrants as also the assignee were required to be impleaded as parties \\nwe may at this stage notice that in law of trade marks by mr k c kailasam while commenting on s 47 of the trade marks act1999 to which our attention has been drawn by mr sudhir chandra it is stated \\nnotes on clauses \\nthis clause corresponds to s 46 of the existing act and provides for removal of a trade mark from the register on the ground of non use \\na trade mark which is not used within five years of its registration becomes liable for removal either completely or in respect of those goods or services for which the mark has not been used \\nunder s 461it is proposed to clarify that the five years period will start from the date on which the trade mark is actually entered on the register \\nthis amendment is intended to remove any ambiguity as for all other purposes the date of registration will be the date on which the application was filed vide cl 232 proviso to sub cl 1 also provides that the tribunal may refuse removal of the mark if it is shown that any proprietor had in fact made bona fide use of the trademark for goods or services of the same description or associated goods or services \\nit is also proposed to increase the period from 1 to 3 months in cl 471a and b in which use of the trade mark prior to the date of filing of the application for removal of the trade mark shall be disregarded \\nthis is intended to prevent the registered proprietor to by pass the act by such token use after he comes to know that an application for removal is about to be filed sub cl 3 protects a mark from being removed from the register on ground of non use if such non use is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade \\nthe clause is proposed to be modified to clarify that special circumstances in the trade will include restrictions imposed by any law or regulation on the use of trade mark in india \\nconsequential amendments have been made to cover services cl 47 of the bill \\nthe court while construing a statute takes into consideration the parliamentary intent in amending the provisions thereof \\nit seeks to enhance the period of moratorium of use of the registered trade mark from one month to three months so as to prevent speculative assignment \\nthus a case of speculative assignment is specifically required to be made out \\nsuch an application may be maintainable in terms of s 56 of the act but strictly not in terms of s 461b thereof and that too in the absence of the original registered proprietor \\nwe are not satisfied with the explanation offered by the first respondent that it gave up the case of non use of the registered trade mark against m s jain industries on the basis of statement made by the learned counsel for the appellant firstly because consent does not confer jurisdiction secondly because want andor lack of jurisdiction on the part of the tribunal can not be waived as if any order is passed without jurisdiction the same would be a nullity and thirdly because the cause of action even according to the first respondent in his application before the high court was different \\nthe counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant did not state that it had waived its right so far as non impleadment of m s jain industries was concerned \\nit only consented for grant of liberty in favour of the first respondent for filing of an application for the self same cause of action \\nthe question of maintainability of the second suit is absence of the registrant proprietor was not and could not have been the subject matter of consent at that stage \\nthe cause of action which permitted the first respondent to file an application for rectification against m s jain industries was non user thereof by it \\nits non user and rectification of the register could not in the aforementioned situation have been tagged with the cause of action if any against the appellant \\nthe second contention of mr that the appellant was an infringer of the trade mark is again a question of fact \\nthe right of the first respondent as a proprietor of the trade mark by reason of a long user is required to be determined vis  vis m s jain industries as also the appellant in the suit filed by it which is pending \\nthe board could not while exercising its jurisdiction under s 461bof the act proceeded on the basis of such presumption \\nit is not correct that no cause of action survived against jain industries \\nit was not lost by reason of assignment as was contended by the learned counsel \\nin the suit only the competing right of the first respondent qua the appellant can be determined and not a right against m s such a right can not be determined in a proceeding under s 461b of the act which is restricted to non user of the registered trade mark \\nboth the appellant and the respondent no 1 were the infringers of the right of m s jain industries as it was the registered proprietor of the trade mark in respect of the goods in question namely centrifugal pumps \\ntwo interpretations of the said provision s 461b are possible \\nwhile interpreting the same however certain basic principles of construction of statute must be kept in mind \\nas it takes away somebody  s right it deserves strict construction \\njurisdiction of the board being dependent on determination of the foundational facts the same was required to be established on the basis of the averments made in the application and not otherwise \\nthe right of a registered trade mark is not lost automatically on the expiry of five years and one month \\nit does not provide for a sun set law \\nit has to be adjudicated upon \\nwhether the registered proprietor of the trade mark had taken recourse to trafficking or not must be determined in an appropriate proceeding \\nthe principle of purchaser of a property has a duty to make enquiriestherefore cannot apply in a case of this nature \\nso long as the right to assign a registered trade mark remains valid once the same is validly assigned the assignee derives the same right as that of the assignor in terms of the statute \\na title to a trade mark derived on assignment as provided for under the act can not be equated with a defective title acquired in any other property as admittedly on the date of assignment the right of the registered trade mark was not extinguished \\nboth the findings of the high court which we have noticed hereinbefore are findings on question of law and in that view of the matter the contention of mr sudhir chandra that the merit of the matter is yet to be gone into by the board can not be a ground for ignoring the submissions made at the bar \\nour attention has again been drawn to a passage from law of trade marks geographical indications by shri k c kailasam wherein the judgment of the tribunal has been criticized in the following terms from the above legislative intent it would seem that the period of non use of the trade mark is to be reckoned continuously from the date of its registration \\nin the case of american home products corporation v mac laboratories pvt ltd \\nrendered under the 1958 act it was held by the supreme court that the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the register has only to prove \\nsuch continuous non user \\nit would appear that neither the u k act nor the indian act at any time envisaged that the commencement of 5 year period of non use is to be delinked from the date of registration of the mark so as to give a fresh lease of life to the registration every time there is change in the ownership of the mark \\nif that be so any registered proprietor could easily defeat an application for rectification by assigning the mark to some other person to have a fresh period of 5 years from the date of assignment and thus effectively frustrate the very object of the provision in s 471a and b further it is to be noted that an assignment is subject to the provisions of the act and any rights vested in any other person see \\ns 37 the assignor can not obviously transfer more rights than he himself has to the assignee under the act \\nwe do not think that the approach of the learned author is entirely correct \\nan assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses \\nif his title is not extinguished by reason of a provision of a statute for non user of the trade mark for a period of five years any assignment made shall be valid subject to such situation which we have noticed in paragraph 25 supra \\nfor the views we have taken we are of the opinion that the impugned judgment can not be sustained \\nit is set aside accordingly \\nthe board shall however proceed to determine afresh the application filed by the first in the light of the legal principles explained above \\nthe appeal is allowed with costs \\ncounsel  s fee assessed at rs 100000 \\nappeal allowed \\n\",\n          \"this appeal by special leave has been preferred by tata consultancy engineers against an award dated 20th december1978 of the industrial tribunal maharashtra bombay revising the wage scales of certain categories of employees and granting various other benefits \\ntata consultant engineers at its inception was a partnership firm but subsequently the partnership was dissolved and in 1974 the undertaking became one of the divisions of tata sons limited \\nit functions as a consulting organisation and a service industry and does not manufacture any product or carry on trade \\nits work force consists of engineers and supervisors and different categories of workmen \\nout of 665 employees at bombay the draftsmen and the administrative staff number 306 these workmen are members of the tata consultant employees union \\nthey served a charter of demands in july1974on the appellant and as their demands were not accepted and conciliation proceedings proved fruitless the state government made a reference of the dispute under s 101 dindustrial tribunal maharashtra for adjudication \\nthe reference was numbered i t no 292 of 1975 \\nthe union filed a statement before the tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments \\nit was urged that the efficiency bar as a feature of the wage scales should be removed \\nthe dearness allowance it was claimed should be granted on a slab system \\nthe claim of the union was resisted by the appellant who maintained that the existing wage scales were fair and reasonable on a region cum industry basis and that it would not be possible for the appellant to bear the additional financial burden if the demands of the union were accepted \\nreference was made to the political uncertainty in iran which had placed an appreciable part of the appellant  s business in jeopardy and to various other factors peculiar to an engineering consultancy business beyond the appellant  s control \\nthere was fierce competition also it was asserted from other similar organisations \\nthe appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised \\nthere was no separate dearness allowance until january1977 when it was introduced for the first time \\nhouse rent allowance was also paid \\ndearness allowance became payable at 10 of the basic wage subject to a minimum of rs 50 and house rent allowance at 30 of the basic salary \\nnothing those facts the tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years there was definite need for revising the wage scales \\nit was pointed out that the dearness allowance and house rent allowance granted by the appellant made little impact in neutralising the cost of living \\nthe need for revising the wage scales was not disputed by the appellant \\nin proceeding to revise the wage structure the tribunal took into account the two principles involved in the process the financial capacity of the industry to bear the burden of an increased wage bill and the prevailing wage structure on an industry cum region basis \\nwage scale statements were filed by the parties before the tribunal pertaining to several engineering consultancy organisations but \\nin the absence of pertinent information concerning the strength of their labour force the extent of their business the financial position for some years the capital invested the precise nature of the business the position regarding reserves dividends declared and future prospects of the company the tribunal found that it was unable to rely on them as comparable concerns \\nholding it impossible in the circumstances to apply the principle of industry cum region basis the tribunal turned to a consideration of the financial capacity of the company to bear an additional burden in this connection it proceeded on the footing that the appellant was a separate and independent division of tata sons limited and had no functional integrality with the other divisions \\nhaving regard to the net profits earned by the appellant from 1968 to 1977 it found that the acceptance of the demands of the union would result in an increased burden of rs 7 crores a burden which would dry up the appellant  s resources and would be impossible for it to bear \\nthe union modified its demands but even the modified terms according to the tribunal appeared to be on the high side inasmuch as the resulting total burden of rs 1 70 crores was much higher than the average profits could sustain \\nthe particular character of the appellant that it was a service industry and not a manufacturing concern was taken into account and it was observed that unlike a manufacturing business there was little scope for diversification in the case of an engineering consultancy \\nnonetheless the tribunal observed there was every reason to expect that the appellant would be able to earn sound profits in the future and the instability in its business activities occasioned by the turbulent political situation in iran would be it was expected compensated by contracts secured in different developing countries \\nfor the purpose of determining the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal followed unichem laboratories v their workmen 1972 indlaw sc 181 where it was held that the gross profits should be computed without making deductions on account of taxation development rebate and depreciation \\nit decided also that there was no ground for deducting the notional value of gratuity \\nrevising the figures on that basis it computed the annual gross profits for the years 1968 to 1977 and determined the annual average at rs 26 69 lakhs \\nthe tribunal took note of the elaborate scales of wages already existing in the wage structure of the appellant and decided to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category \\nit also observed that the category of draughtsmen needed a special increase \\nbut it rejected the demand of the union for dearness allowance on the basis of a slab system because that would have imposed an unacceptable burden on the appellant  s financial capacity and there was no reason why the existing scheme of dearness allowance should be disturbed when a substantial increase was being made in the level of the basic wage \\ntaking into account the circumstance that besides the staff of 306 workmen represented by the union there were several other employees who would also have to be paid the tribunal considered it fair in paragraph 23 of the award to give a flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories \\nit rejected the demand of the union for abolishing the efficiency bar but the span of 15 years for earning increment was expanded in some grades to 20 years and some adjustments were also made in specific grades \\nthe tribunal also noted that after the salaries of the employees had been fixed in the respective scales senior employees would have to be given some more increments in the new scales according to their completed years of service \\ntaking all these factors into consideration it made an award dated 20th december1978 prescribing the following revision in the existing scales of wages \\nthe tribunal maintained the existing schemes of dearness allowance and house rent allowance and observed that in view of the revised basic wages there would be a resultant increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance \\nthe revised wage scales the tribunal directed should take effect retrospectively from 1st january1976 it also laid down the principle enabling the actual fitment of the workmen in their respective wage scales as on that date and also provided for the number of increments to which they would be entitled having regard to the period of completed service \\ntwo days after the award was made an application was made by the union stating in the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance \\nfurther it appears that the tribunal intended to grant the increase of rs 150 to each draughtsman and rs 100 to all other workmen in their basic pay \\nhowever this is not clearly mentioned anywhere in the award due to accidental slip or omission \\nthe union prayed that the position may be clarified and the award corrected accordingly \\non the same date the tribunal disposed of the application by the following order there can be no doubt that a flat increase of rs 150 to each of the employees in the category of draftsmen and of rs 100 to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award \\nthe same has been made clear in paragraph \\nno 23but it appears that the words to each employee after the figure rs 150 were omitted \\nsimilarly the same words to each employee after the figure 100 were omitted \\nwhen the award is sent for publication a necessary corrigendum be made in the award and the aforesaid words after the figures rs 150 and rs 100 be added \\nit may be mentioned that only from that point of view viz to grant flat increase of rs 150 and of rs 100 to the employees in the category of draftsmen and the other categories respectively that a burden statement was called for from the company and the same was submitted vide exhibit c 51 the fitment has also to be done only after the flat increase is added to the present basic salary of each employee \\ni do not think that any problem would arise for interpretation of the award \\nsince the award has been already signed i do not think anything further can be added to this award \\nsd k n wani industrial tribunal \\nin this appeal the learned counsel for the appellant had covered a wide field but in the end he states that the appellant is aggrieved by two matters only \\none is the retrospectivity attached to the revised wage scales and the other is the flat increase given to each employee of rs 150 in the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in other categories resulting from the order dated 22nd december1978 \\nthe workmen have filed an appeal by special leave civil appeal no 2300 of 1979in which they have challenged the rejection by the tribunal of their claim in respect of dearness allowance which they contend should be pegged to the cost of living index and should not be a fixed amount \\nconsidering the appeal of tata consulting engineers first the contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal erred in making the wage scales retrospective and in any event in ranging the retrospectivity back to 1st january1976 \\nwe have been taken through some of the material on the record in the attempt to support the contention but after giving careful thought to the matter i think there is ample justification for what the tribunal did \\nit must be remembered that although the wage scales were introduced as long ago as 1973 they were maintained at that level except for a slight revision some time thereafter \\nno dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time \\nthe cost of living had gone on increasing from 1972 onwards and as the tribunal has found the dearness allowance and house rent allowance made no appreciable impact in neutralising the increasing cost \\nduring all these years the appellant had continued to enjoy increasing profits nonetheless the emoluments received by the workmen did not receive the impress of the appellant  s growing prosperity \\nthe charter of demands was presented by the union in july1974 and when conciliation proceedings failed the state government made the reference to the industrial tribunal in 1975 the tribunal has referred to various considerations which prevailed with it in giving retrospectivity to the revised pay scales \\nthey are considerations which can not be ignored \\naccordingly the contention raised on behalf of the appellant against retrospectivity of the wage scales must be rejected \\nthe challenge embodied in the second contention against the amendment of the award is more serious \\nit is urged that the amendment results in the inclusion of a flat increase of rs 150 to each workman in the case of draughtsman and rs 100 to each workman in the case of other categories a result wholly unwarranted it is said by the intent of the original award and therefore falling beyond the jurisdiction of the tribunal \\nin making the application of 22nd \\ndecember1978the union invoked the jurisdiction of the \\ntribunal under rule 31 of the industrial disputes bombay rules1957 rule 31 provides the labour court tribunal or arbitrator may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any award it or he issues \\nthe jurisdiction given to the tribunal by rule 31 is closely circumscribed \\nit is only a clerical mistake or error which can be corrected and the clerical mistake or error must arise from an accidental slip or omission in the award \\nan accidental slip or omission implies that something was intended and contrary to that intention what should not have been included has been included or what should have been included has been omitted \\nit must be a mistake or error amenable to clerical correction only \\nit must not be a mistake or error which calls for rectification by modification of the conscious adjudication on the issues involved \\nis the instant case one where the amendment made by the tribunal in the original award can be said to correct a mere clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission \\nto answer the question it is necessary to examine the basis of the award and the intent which flows from that basis \\nthe terms of reference in the state government  s order required the tribunal to revise the scales of pay and dearness allowance and there was no mention of giving any ad hoc increase in the basic pay of individual workman \\nit would do well to recall that the claim of the union filed before the tribunal also centered on the need to revise the wage scales \\nthat was the main issue between the parties \\nit is to the task of revising the pay scales that the tribunal addressed itself and throughout the material part of the award it is that task which held its focussed attention \\nthe financial capacity of the appellant and the related study of its annual profits from 1968 to 1977were examined from that view point \\nthe sufficiency of the existing pay scales was considered in detail and regard was had to their original structure and the accretions made subsequently by way of dearness allowance and house rent allowance \\nfor the purpose of restructuring the pay scales the tribunal ruled on the paying capacity of the appellant both with reference to the profits of the preceding year as well as the prospects of the future \\nthe financial capacity as the tribunal observed constituted one of the principles which are required to be followed in the fixation of the wage structure \\na clear statement of its intention is found in paragraph 22 of the award where the tribunal stated i only propose to modify the existing structures of the scales with flat increases in each category \\nno ad hoc increase to the pay of each individual workman was intended \\nand that is confirmed by what was stated in paragraph 23 of the award considering this outgoing the flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draughtsman and rs 100 in the case of the other categories would be fair \\nit will be noted that the pay scales of different categories were being restructured and the flat increase envisaged there related to an increase in the general pay scales of different categories \\nindividual workmen were not present to the mind of the tribunal \\nthat the increase was pertinent to the general pay scales in the revised wage structure is patently clear from a comparison of the existing pay scales and the revised pay scales \\nthe comparative table of existing pay scales and the revised pay scales has been reproduced earlier \\nthe revised pay scales of all categories except the category of draughtsmen shows an increase of rs 100 in the initial pay fixed in each scale the increase in the case of the category of draughtsmen being rs 150  there was only one increase contemplated in the award in paragraph 23 of award and it is more than plain that the increase was the one incorporated in the revised pay scales pertaining to different categories \\nno second flat increase was envisaged at all \\nthe amendment made by the tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase this time to each individual workmen \\nif as the tribunal has stated in the amendment order the increase in paragraph 23 was intended to apply to each individual workmen there is nothing in the body of the award to form the foundation on which the actual figures in the restructured pay scales can be made to rest \\nthere will be no explanation why the initial start of the revised pay scales has been increased by rs 150 in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories \\nconsidering the fitment of the workman in the revised scales it was stated in the award that a workman found drawing a salary less than the beginning of the grade would be stepped up to the beginning of the grade and if his pay fell between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay was to be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale \\nconspicuous by its absence is any reference to a flat increase in the pay of an individual workmen \\neven when considering the range of permissible retrospectivity the tribunal stated in the award in view of the revision of the wage scales there would be consequent increase in the dearness allowance and the house rent allowance \\nand the clinching circumstances of all is that the award was made on the basis that the overall financial load according to paragraph 33 of the award would be to the tune of about rs 5 lakhs \\nit was that figure which the tribunal had in mind against the backdrop of the gross annual figures when it made the revised pay scales retrospective from 1st \\njanuary1976 this liability taken with the liability accruing on the need to increase the salaries of the other staff determined the tribunal  s deliberations in regard to the several features of the award including the grant of increments related to completed periods of service the expansion of the span from 15 years to 20 years for earning increments and other benefits \\nit can not be the case of the union that the figure of rs 5 lakhs mentioned in paragraph 33 of the award represented the result of adding a flat increase to the pay of each workman in addition to the benefits conferred by the revised pay scales and other awarded reliefs \\nin its order of 22nd \\ndecember1978the tribunal has referred to the statement exhibit c 51 filed by the appellant when called upon to indicate the increased financial burden apprehended by it \\nthe tribunal has relied on this statement as evidence showing that the appellant knew that a flat increase of rs 150 and rs 100 was intended to each of the employees in the category of draughtsmen and the other categories \\nin so construing the statement exhibit c 51the tribunal has grievously erred \\nit seems from a perusal of the document exhibit c 51that it is a statement giving trial figures of the increased financial load on different bases \\non the basis that a sum of rs 150 per month was added to the pay of each draughtsman and a sum of rs 100 was added to the pay of every other workman who belonged to the union staff the financial load would increase to rs 922032  likewise if a flat increase of rs 100 was given to individual workmen of all categories including draughtsmen the increased financial load would total rs 764256  the statement then goes on to indicate that if a flat increase of rs 75 per month were given to individual workmen of all categories the total increase would be rs 578220  again if the flat increase is rs 65 per month to the individual workmen of all categories the additional load would total rs 497772  finally on the basis that the individual draughtsman would be given an increase of rs 75 per month and the individual workmen of other categories rs 50 per month the additional load was calculated at rs 463092  it will be noted that the statement exhibit c 51was prepared on the basis of the employees strength as in december1971 a similar statement was prepared on the basis of the employees strength as in september1978 these statements can not be regarded as evidence that the appellant was cognizant of the intention of the tribunal to provide a flat increase to the pay of each workman \\nthe statement afforded an indication merely of what the additional financial load would be if a flat increase was given to the individual workman on the alternative basis set forth therein \\nnone of the alternatives was actually adopted by the tribunal because when the award was made the tribunal proceeded instead to restructure the wage scales by the addition of rs 150 in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories to the initial pay in the wage scales pertaining to those categories \\nthe addition was integrated as a feature of the wage scales it was not regarded as an addition to the pay of each individual workman \\nit seems that the tribunal was betrayed by a curious confusion in accepting the plea of the union that a flat increase to the pay of each workman was intended in the original wage and consequently it fell into the error of amending the award \\nthe evidence contained in the award throughout provides incontrovertible proof that this flat increase was never originally intended in the award \\nthe amendment has resulted in the tribunal making as it were a supplementary award whereby a further relief is being granted beyond that granted in the original award \\nthe original award was completed and signed by the tribunal and it can not be reopened now except for the limited purpose of rule 31 in travelling outside and beyond the terms of the original award the tribunal has committed a jurisdictional error \\nour attention has been drawn to what purports to be an endorsement by counsel for the appellant on the application dated 22nd december1978 filed by the union before the tribunal to the effect that the appellant would submit to whatever the tribunal decided and it is urged that the appellant is bound by the order made on the application \\nit is an accepted principle that consent by a party can not confer jurisdiction on a court \\nwhat is without jurisdiction will remain so \\nin the circumstances the order of 22nd december1978 is invalid so far as it amends paragraph 23 of the original award \\nthe corrigendum amending the award in consequence is liable to be quashed \\nthe second contention of the appellant is entitled to succeed \\ni shall now consider civil appeal no 2300 of 1979 filed by the workmen \\nthe only contention of the workmen is that the tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index \\nit is wrong in principle it is said to provide a fixed dearness allowance \\nreliance was placed on the hindustan times ltd new delhi v their workmen 1964 1 scr 234 1962 indlaw sc 436247 where it was observed by this court that dearness allowance should not remain fixed at any figure but should be on a sliding scale in order to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living \\nreference was also made to bengal chemical pharmaceutical works limited v its workmen \\n2 scr 113 1968 indlaw sc 183 now it is not a universal rule that the dearness allowance should in all cases be correlated with the cost of living index \\nthe tribunal in the present case considered the matter and found it sufficient and in accord with justice that the wage scales should be restructured with suitable increments provided therein \\nit noted that dearness allowance was being granted by the appellant at 10 of the salary subject to a minimum of rs 50 and house rent allowance at 30 of the basic salary \\nhaving regard to the not inconsiderable improvement in the level of the basic wage it observed that there would be a consequent increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance \\nin view of the increase so secured the tribunal rejected the suggestion that a slab system should be introduced in the dearness allowance or that there should be any other modification of the principle on which dearness allowance was being presently granted \\nit declared that the cumulative effect of an improved wage structure together with dearness allowance operating on a slab system would throw an impossible burden of about rs 1 crore on the financial capacity of the appellant \\nit was open to the tribunal to adopt the position which it did \\nif the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered \\nthe award is a composite document in which the several elements of increased wage scales larger increments longer span of 20 years for earning increments dearness allowance at 10 of the basic wage besides several other benefits have been integrated into a balanced arrangement in keeping with what the tribunal has found to be the financial capacity of the appellant \\nit is not possible to maintain one part of the award and supersede another \\naccordingly the appeal filed by the workmen must fail \\nin the result civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 is allowed in part insofar that the order dated 22nd december1978 of the industrial tribunal maharashtra bombay is quashed to the extent that it modifies the original award dated 20th december1978and the corrigendum made consequent thereto is also quashed \\ncivil appeal no 2300 of 1979 is dismissed \\nthere is no order as to costs \\nchinnappa reddy j we have had the advantage of perusing the judgment prepared by our learned brother pathak j we agree with him that civil appeal no 2300 of 1979 should be dismissed \\nwe also agree with him that civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 should also be dismissed in so far as it relates to the award dated december 201978 however we do not agree with our learned brother that civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 should be allowed in so far as it relates to the order dated december 221978 of the industrial tribunal which purports to correct the award dated december 201978 in our opinion civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 should be dismissed in its entirety \\nwe do not propose to give our reasons to the extent we are in agreement with pathak j and we propose to state our reasons for the disagreement only \\nit is needless to recapitulate all the basic facts which have been set out in the judgment of pathak j the award of the industrial tribunal was made on december 201978 on december 221978 that is to say two days after the award was made and when everything must have been fresh to the minds of the tribunal the respective parties and their advocates the employees union made an application under rule 31 of the industrial disputes bombay rules1957 seeking a correction of an error which it was claimed had crept into the award \\nthe application was as follows in the above reference your honour was pleased to pass an award on 20th december1978 \\nin the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance \\nfurther it appears that the tribunal intended to grant the increase of rs 150 to each draughtsman and rs 100 to all other workmen in their basic pay \\nthe union therefore prays the honourable tribunal to clarify the position and correct the award accordingly \\non this application the advocate for the employer company made the following endorsement submitted to whatever this honourable tribunal desires to do \\nthereafter the tribunal made an order on the same day in the following terms there can be no doubt that a flat increase of rs 150 to each of the employees in the category of draftsmen and of rs 100 to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award \\nthis order was made in the presence of shri manak gagrat advocate for the company and shri n p mehta advocate for the workmen \\nthe endorsement made on the application by the advocate for the company does not indicate that the company had any objection to the award being corrected as sought by the employees union \\non the other hand the endorsement reads as if there was tacit agreement on the part of the company to the correction sought by the union \\nthe order dated december 221978 of the tribunal also does not reveal that there was any opposition by the company to the application for correcting the award \\neven so we propose to examine whether the correction sought by the employees union was within the bounds of the authority of the tribunal or whether it was in effect a fresh award \\nthe primary and basic question considered by the industrial tribunal in making the award dated december 201978 was the question of revision of the wage scales \\nimplicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage scales and flat or ad hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary \\nit can not possibly be doubted that an industrial tribunal deciding upon the wage scales of the employees of an establishment would have full liberty to propose ad hoc increase of salaries as part of the revision of wages \\nnor can it be doubted that fitment into the revised pay scales is certainly a part of the revision of pay scales \\nthis in our opinion is elementary and fundamental to the jurisdiction of the industrial tribunal in revising wage scales \\nin the present case the industrial tribunal on a consideration of the material placed before it came to the conclusion that the company was in an undoubted position to bear the additional financial burden \\nat the end of paragraph 15 of the award the tribunal stated but there can be no doubt that the company can very well bear the additional burden \\nthe question is what should be the extent of such burden \\nat the end of paragraph 18 of the award the tribunal said a mere reading of exhibit u 15 will immediately dispel the misgivings about the future of the present company \\nfor some years to come this is likely to be one of the few consulting engineers who will be securing major contracts \\nagain in paragraph 19 it was said i have no doubt that the present company would be able to bear the additional burden for the years to come \\nthis is further borne out from the trading results of the company for the year 1968 69 to 1977 the profits have increased all along \\nthe copy of the letter dated july 231973alongwith \\nthe annexures from the company to the director general posts telegraphs delhi ex \\nc 27 indicates the important projects the company was handling in india and abroad and the amount of foreign exchange earned and repatriated \\ni will therefore proceed on the ground that the present company can bear the additional financial burden \\nfinally at the end of paragraph 21 \\nthe tribunal said in view of this position the company can easily bear some burden that might fall as a result of the upward revision of the wage scales \\nthe question is to what extent the relief should be given to the employees \\nafter expressing himself in categoric terms about the capacity of the company to bear the additional financial burden the tribunal went on to say i only propose to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category \\nthe tribunal then considered the question whether draftsmen should get a higher flat increase and the question whether the existing scheme of dearness allowance should be revised \\nthe tribunal then observed the flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draftsmen and rs 100 in the case of the other categories would be fair \\nthereafter various other matters were considered and finally the tribunal revised the wage scales in the manner already mentioned by my brother pathak j the question of fitment was then considered in the following manner fitment if as on 1st january1976an employee is drawing a salary less than the beginning of the respective grade he should be first stepped up to the beginning of the grade \\nif the pay of an employee does not coincide with any step in the revised pay scale and falls between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay of that employee shall be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale \\nafter fixing the salary of the employees in the scales as above the employees should be given increments in the new scales as noted below i employees who have completed 5 years or more as on 1st january19763 increments \\nii employees who have completed 4 years of service as on 1st january19762 increments \\nall other employees with more than one year  s service shall be given one increment \\nnow if without any flat or ad hoc increase of salary the workmen were to be fitted into the revised scales of pay it would obviously result in serious anomalous situations \\nin the case of several senior employees the revised scale would yield but a very small and almost a token increase in the size of the pay packet whereas the junior employees would get a large benefit \\nwhile workmen raising industrial disputes for revision of wage scales are certainly minded about their future prospects in the matter of wages they surely would be more concerned with the immediate benefits according to them \\nthat was why the industrial tribunal thought that an all round flat increase of rs 150 in the case of draftsmen and rs 100 in the case of other workmen was called for \\nit was clearly so intended by the tribunal as is evident from the reference to flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draftsmen and rs 100 in the case of the other categories \\nsince there was to be a flat increase of rs 150 and rs 100 in the case of draftsmen and other workmen respectively the revised wage scale had necessarily to commence with figures rs 150 and rs 100 above the existing wage scales \\nimmediately after the award was pronounced while the iron was still hot as it were the employees apparently realised that the employer might take advantage of the circumstance that it was not clearly mentioned in the award that all the employees were to get additional pay of rs 150 and rs 100 respectively and might contend that the tribunal had only revised the wage scales by increasing the salary on entry into the service and restructuring the scale of pay and never granted any ad hoc increase of salary to all employees \\ntherefore they filed an application before the tribunal for correcting the award so as to bring out what was intended \\nas it has now turned out what the employees apparently suspected the employer might contend is precisely what the employer is not contending though the employer did not choose to so contend before the industrial tribunal itself when the employees filed the application for rectification \\nthe application before the tribunal was filed under rule 31 of the bombay industrial disputes rules 1957which is as follows \\na board court labour court tribunal or arbitrator may at any time suo moto or on an application made by any of the parties concerned may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any proceedings report award or as the case may be decision \\nthe omission of the words to each employee first after the figure rs 150 and again after the figure rs 100 was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the tribunal was entitled to correct \\nwe are unable to see how it can be held to be otherwise \\nwe are not impressed with the submission of the learned counsel for the company that the corrigendum was in effect a fresh award \\nwe therefore see no ground for quashing the order dated december 221978 of the tribunal \\nthe result of the foregoing discussion is that civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 has to be dismissed in its entirety \\nwe have already indicated that we agree with our brother pathak j that the appeal civil appeal no 2300 of 1979 filed by the workmen should also be dismissed \\nwhile we find lot of force in the submission of shri v m tarkunde learned counsel for the workmen that dearness allowance linked to cost of living index is ordinarily the best and the most scientific method of computing dearness allowance it can not always be said that an illegality warranting interference under article 136 is committed if some other method is adopted \\nthe tribunal has given satisfactory reason for adopting a different mode and we are not disposed to interfere with the award of the tribunal \\nin the result both the appeals are dismissed without any order as to costs \\nthe order of the court was as follows \\nin view of the opinion of the majority both the appeals are dismissed and there is no order as to costs \\n\",\n          \"ujjagar singh the appellant herein a resident of village bangawali tehsil malerkotla was tried and convicted by the additional sessions judge sangrur for the murder of his niece mukhtiar kaur and was awarded the death penalty \\nin addition he was convicted for an offence punishable section 376 of the ipc and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to a fine of rs 5 000 and in default of payment to undergo further r i for one year and section 309 of the ipc to a sentence of simple imprisonment for one year \\nthe aforesaid convictions and sentences have been maintained by the high court and the matter is before us in these proceedings by way of special leave \\nthe facts of the case are as under \\nat about 2 00 p m on 10th november 2002 a boy whose identity is not forthcoming informed satnam singh pw2 that an incident of firing had taken place in the house of ujjagar singh situated in the fields on the outskirts of the village \\nsatnam singh conveyed this information to sarpanch jora singh pw1 who was attending a marriage at that time \\njora singh accompanied by gurdeep singh pw3 thereupon rushed to ujjagar singh  s house and found mukhtiar kaur lying dead with a gun shot injury and the appellant also with a gun shot injury lying unconscious on the ground in the adjoining room \\njora singh and gurdeep singh immediately removed ujjagar singh to the civil hospital dhuri in the jeep belonging to kulwant singh pw4 \\njora singh also met inspector harjinder pal singh pw14 at 4 40 p m near the hospital who recorded his statement at that place and with his endorsement exhibit p a sent it to police station dhuri where the formal fir was registered at about 4 45 p m with the special report being delivered to the illaka magistrate at dhuri itself at 6 20 p m the same evening \\nthe facts as narrated were that arjan singh of village bangawali had three sons puran singh ujjagar singh appellant and ajmer singh \\npuran singh had died about 20 years earlier leaving behind his wife two sons and a daughter mukhtiar kaur \\nthe two sons and the wife also died long before the incident and mukhtiar kaur the sole surviving member of this branch of the family had been married to balwinder singh pw9 about 9 or 10 years earlier \\npuran singh had however transferred 30 or 35 bighas of agricultural land falling to his share after the death of his father in the name of the appellant  s sons by a collusive decree in the year 1994 and the suggestion was that this transaction had been objected to by mukhtiar kaur who was demanding that the land be returned to her \\nit appears that mukhtiar kaur  s relations with her in laws had got strained and she had left her matrimonial home and come to live with ujjagar singh her uncle 7 or 8 months earlier and the suggestion was that mukhtiar kaur had been killed by the appellant with his licensed gun and he had thereafter attempted to commit suicide \\nhaving recorded the aforesaid facts in the fir pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh reached the place of incident and lifted one spent 12 bore cartridge case shaktiman make from near mukhtiar kaur  s dead body and one dbbl gun from the place where ujjagar singh appeared to have been shot and another spent cartridge case was recovered from the right barrel of the gun \\nafter completion of the investigation at the spot mukhtiar kaur  s dead body was sent for its post mortem examination \\nthe post mortem examination was also conducted by pw5 dr ishwar singh medical officer civil hospital along with dr harwinder kaur pw17 and it was found that mukhtiar kaur had two gunshot injuries on her dead body a wound of entry on the back of right side of chest 2 cm x 1 cm with margining and blackening and a corresponding exit wound of 5 cm x 3 5 cm to the front of the right side of the chest \\ndr harwinder kaur aforesaid also took swabs from the vagina of the deceased and as per the chemical examiner  s report dated 2 1 2003 semen was found on the swab taken from the vagina and from the underwear that mukhtiar kaur had been wearing at the time of her death \\nthe weapon and the recovered cartridge cases had also been sent to the forensic science laboratory which in its report dated 4 8 2004 opined that the crime cartridge case ci could have been fired by the right barrel of the weapon whereas the crime cartridge case c2 had been fired from the right barrel \\non the completion of the investigation a charge sheet under sections 302 376 and 309 of the ipc was filed against the accused and as he pleaded not guilty he was brought to trial \\nduring the trial jora singh pw1 satnam singh pw2 gurdeep singh pw3 and kulwant singh pw4 resiled from their statements given to the police and were declared hostile \\nbalwinder singh pw9 however supported the prosecution case deposing that the land had in fact been got transferred from gurmail kaur mother of mukhtiar kaur to ujjagar singh by fraud and mukhtiar kaur was therefore entitled to its return \\nhe also deposed that mukhtiar kaur had told him some time earlier that the accused had been beating her and had also committed sexual intercourse with her and that at about 11 p m on 10 11 2002 karam singh pw10 had informed him as to what had transpired on which he along with his father hamir singh pw12 and several others had rushed to bangawali \\npw10 karam singh aforesaid confirmed the story given by balwinder singh \\nthe prosecution also relied on the statements of dr vijay kumar pw6 of the civil hospial dhuri who testified that the appellant had been brought to the hospital at about 2 45 p m on 10 11 2002 with a serious gun shot injury dr ripan miglani pw15 of the dayanand medical college hospital ludhiana who deposed that he had been admitted to the department of neuro surgery with a serious gun shot injury and dr sanjay uppal pw16 a plastic surgeon who disclosed that the appellant had been under his treatment for almost 5 weeks and the burnt area around the firearm injury had been removed by him \\nthe prosecution also placed reliance on the statement of asi jasbir singh pw11 who had accompanied inspector harjinder pal singh pw14 to the place of incident and supported the recoveries made from the spot \\nthe prosecution case was then put to the accused and his statement recorded section \\n313 of the cr \\np c in reply to question 33 he stated as under i am innocent \\ni have been implicated falsely in this case \\ni was treating mukhtiar kaur as my daughter and loved her as my daughter \\nfalse allegations have been levelled against me \\ni never harassed mukhtiar kaur nor ever got her land mutated from her mother by fraud \\ni have not killed mukhtiar kaur \\nmother of mukhtiar kaur got the land mutated by her own free will and mukhtiar kaur had no dispute about it \\nbalwinder singh her husband was addicted to vices and used to beat her due to which she used to remain under depression and sick generally and used to come to me as my daughter \\nmy house kothi is situated on the outer skirts of village bangawali and door planks had not been fixed so far to rooms \\nsome body suddenly came and fired at me \\ni fell down on the ground and became unconscious \\ntherefore i could not see what had happened to mukhtiar kaur as she was in other room \\nlater on i came to know that some body had fired at her and she died \\ni regained consciousness in hospital \\nthe story of rape by me with her has been fabricated by her husband as he is inimical towards me \\neven i do not know who took me to hospital \\ni have been implicated in this case falsely \\nthe trial court and the high court relying on the circumstances available on the evidence convicted and sentenced the appellant as already mentioned above \\nmr goburdhan the learned counsel for the accused has raised several arguments in the course of hearing \\nhe has pointed out that there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that mukhtiar kaur had been subjected to rape and in this view of the matter the very basis for the imposition of the death penalty was not made out \\nhe has also pointed out that there were no eye witnesses to the incident and the 4 witnesses i e jora singh and others who had reached the place of incident and carried the injured appellant to the hospital had also resiled and as the prosecution story now rested on circumstantial evidence alone it was imperative for the investigating officer to have taken the finger prints from the weapon and that in any case the recovery of the spent cartridges and the gun were clearly suspicious as the weapon had been sent to the laboratory after an inordinate delay \\nit has also been submitted that in a case of attempted suicide a firearm must of necessity be used from a very close range and the absence of any blackening charring or burning around the wound on ujjagar singh clearly ruled out the possibility of such an attempt \\nit has finally been submitted that the land had been transferred in the name of ujjagar singh  s sons in the year 1994 by gurmail kaur mother of mukhtiar kaur by a collusive decree and there was no evidence to show that mukhtiar kaur had ever displayed any unhappiness or made any complaint to any person or any authority with regard to the decree and as such the very basis of the prosecution story did not exist \\nthe learned state counsel has however supported the judgment of the courts below \\nhe has further emphasized that the prosecution  s case stood proved from various factors including the medical evidence the reports of the forensic science laboratory the chemical examiner from the post mortem reports and the recovery of the gun and cartridges \\nwe have heard the learned counsel for the parties and gone through the record \\nwe first take up for consideration the question of the conviction section 376 of the ipc \\nwe find from the medical evidence and from the chemical examiner  s reports that the vaginal swab and clothes taken from the dead body did indicate the presence of semen \\nthere is however absolutely no evidence to suggest even assuming that the intercourse had been committed by the appellant that he had done so without mukhtiar kaur  s consent or against her will \\nsome suspicions of rape could perhaps have been raised had some tell tale injuries been detected on mukhtiar kaur  s person but we find that the two injuries other than the gun shot wounds i e injury no 3 being on the left pinna and \\nno 4 an abrasion near the right eye do not indicate any attempt to rape or the commission of rape \\nit is also significant that the investigators had made no attempt whatsoever to have the appellant medically examined to ascertain his capacity to perform sexual intercourse \\nthe learned state counsel relying on the statement of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh has however submitted that the examination had not been possible as the appellant had received a very serious gun shot injury and was hanging between life and death \\nwe agree with the submission of the learned counsel that an examination could not have been carried out immediately \\nbut we see no justification in the omission of the prosecution to have him examined after he had recovered his health and been discharged from hospital \\nwe are further of the opinion that even assuming for a moment that sexual intercourse between the two had indeed taken place it can not be said from the evidence before us that it was without the consent or against the wishes of mukhtiar kaur \\nwe therefore find that ujjagar singh  s conviction section 376 of the ipc can not be sustained \\nmr goburdhan has placed great emphasis on the fact that as the four witnesses who had reached the place of incident i e jora singh satnam singh gurdeep singh and kulwant singh had resiled from their statements and had disowned their initial stories the prosecution had of necessity to rely on circumstantial evidence and if the chain of circumstances remained incomplete or even if one link in the chain was broken the prosecution must fail \\nhe has also relied on the judgment of balu sonba shinde v state of maharashtra 2002 7 scc 543 2002 indlaw sc 1923 to contend that it was open to the accused to take advantage insofar as possible from the statement of a witness though declared hostile and the four witnesses having disowned the prosecution story and having given a different version the appellant was entitled to derive such benefit as possible in this situation \\nthe learned state counsel has however emphasized that both the trial court and the high court had for good reasons opined that the circumstances made out a case for conviction and the accused having given a counter version some obligation lay on him as well to explain the circumstances against him inasmuch that admittedly he and the victim were alone in the house at the time of the incident \\nreliance for this argument has been placed on the decision of raj kumar prasad tamarkar v state of bihar anr 20071 \\nscale 19 2007 indlaw sc 5 \\nwe have considered their arguments very carefully \\nin mahmood v state of u p 1976 1 scc 542 1975 indlaw sc 643 it has been observed that in a case dependent wholly on circumstantial evidence the court must be satisfied athat the circumstances from which the inference of guilt is to be drawn have been fully established by unimpeachable evidence beyond a shadow of doubt bthat the circumstances are of a determinative tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused and cthat the circumstances taken collectively are incapable of explanation on any reasonable hypothesis save that of the guilt sought to be proved against him \\nin this case this court held that the omission of the prosecution inter alia to have the finger prints found on the alleged murder weapon was fatal to the prosecution story \\nin 1984 4 scc 116 sharad birdhichand sarda v state of maharashtra 1984 indlaw sc 432 this court discussed the ratio of the judgments in hanumant v state of m p air 1952 sc 343

maharashtra 1973 2 scc 793 1973 indlaw sc 181 and observed thus a close analysis of this decision would show that the following conditions must be fulfilled before a case against an accused can be said to be fully established 1the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established \\nit may be noted here that this court indicated that the circumstances concerned must or should and not may be established \\nthere is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between may be proved and must be or should be proved as was held by this court in shivaji sahabrao bobade v state of maharashtra 1973 indlaw sc 181 where the following observations were made \\ncertainly it is a primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and the mental distance between may be is long and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions \\n2the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused that is to say they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty 3the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency 4they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved and 5there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused \\nmr goburdhan has also cited mahmood v state of u p 1976 1 scc 542

sc 144 in support of his plea relating to the evaluation of circumstantial evidence \\nthese judgments have broadly followed the principles laid down in the judgments referred to above and need not therefore be dealt with us in extenso \\nit must nonetheless be emphasized that whether a chain is complete or not would depend on the facts of each case emanating from the evidence and no universal yardstick should ever be attempted \\nit is in this background that we must examine the circumstances in the present case \\na few facts stand out from the prosecution story \\nfirst the place of incident being adjoining rooms in the residential house of the appellant and the fact that the alleged murder weapon is his licensed dbbl gun is proved on record \\nthe evidence also reveals that the appellant was living in the premises along with his wife mother and son and two daughters who were studying outside the village were frequent visitors but it is the admitted position that nobody but the appellant and the deceased were present at the time of incident \\nit is also clear from the evidence that the two spent cartridge cases recovered one from near mukhtiar kaur  s dead body and the second from the right barrel of the gun lying near the appellant had been sent to the forensic science laboratory which opined that one of the cartridges had been fired from the gun and the other could have been fired therefrom \\nmr goburdhan has however laid great emphasis on the fact that no reference to the gun or cartridges had been made in the inquest report and that in any case the weapon and the spent cartridges had been sent to the laboratory belatedly \\nwe are of the opinion however that no adverse inference can be drawn from either of these circumstances \\nthe aforesaid articles had been carried to the laboratory by constable gopal singh who in his affidavit dated 17th march 2003 deposed that he had first taken the articles to the laboratory on 9th december 2002 but they had been returned by the director on the ground that the seals affixed thereon were not of the requisite number and that after removing the objections raised by the director the articles aforesaid had been returned to the laboratory on 18th december 2002 \\ngopal singh was cross examined by the prosecution \\nand but for some inconsequential questions put to him with regard to the seals not even a suggestion was made that the aforesaid articles had in any way been tampered with \\nit is true as contended that in column 22 of the inquest report which refers to the articles found near the dead body there is no reference to the spent cartridges or the murder weapon but we find from a perusal of the site plan exh \\npjj prepared by the investigating officer inspector harjinder pal singh pw14 on 10th november 2002 that the weapon is shown lying close to the place where the appellant had been found unconscious and a spent cartridge recovered from near the dead body of mukhtiar kaur \\nit has also been submitted by mr goburdhan that there appeared to be no motive for the incident as the story about mukhtiar kaur  s unhappiness about the transfer of land to the sons of ujjagar singh sought to be proved by pw9 balwinder singh and pw10 karam singh had been disbelieved by the high court with the observation that the statements of these two witnesses could not be relied upon \\nit is true that in a case relating to circumstantial evidence motive does assume great importance but to say that the absence of motive would dislodge the entire prosecution story is perhaps giving this one factor an importance which is not due and to use the clichi \\nthe motive is in the mind of the accused and can seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy \\nthere is however a hint in the testimony of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh that his enquiries had revealed that the accused was having illicit relations with mukhtiar kaur and we can assume that some thing untoward had happened which could have triggered the volatile and hostile incident \\nthere could perhaps be some truth in this suggestion as it is significant that though the appellant had an extended family living with him i e mother wife son living in the village and two young daughters who were studying outside and residing in a hostel but were frequent visitors home yet none of them has come forth to depose in his favour \\nto our mind therefore this is yet another circumstance inculpating the accused \\nmr goburdhan has also laid much stress on the apparent discordance between the prosecution story and the medical evidence and has argued that had the accused attempted to commit suicide the gun shot must of necessity had to be fired from a very close range on which the wound would have marks of burning or charring and that in any event a full blooded shot from a very close range would have torn his face apart \\nhe has in this connection referred us to the statement of dr ripan miglani pw15 and the wound found on the appellant at the time of his medical examination in the department of surgery of the dayanand medical college hospital ludhiana which was about 15 x 8 cm curvilinear wound present on the left half of face extending upto bone \\nno blackening or foreign body was visible \\nunderlying muscles were exposed and contamination was present \\nhe has thus urged that the absence of any blackening underlined the argument that the shot had been fired from some distance and as such an attempt at suicide was clearly to be ruled out \\nhe has also drawn our attention to the cross examination of the doctor wherein he reiterated that there was no visible blackening and that it was not possible for him to say whether the injury was suicidal or otherwise \\nthe learned state counsel has however relied on the statement of pw16 dr sanjay uppal who was apparently the first doctor to have examined the appellant wherein he clearly testified that the blackened portion around the firearm injury had been removed by him \\nwe are therefore of the opinion that this statement falsifies mr goburdhan  s argument on this aspect \\nit is also significant that the shot had apparently travelled upwards skirting the mandible through the flesh of the cheek in an upward direction with minimal damage to the bone structure and it is indeed providential that the appellant got away with only an injury albeit a very serious one \\nthe fact that the shot was fired from below going upwards is also supported by the site plan exh \\npjj wherein marks of a shot hitting the roof were seen at point e whereas the appellant was found lying at point d in the same room \\nit is therefore apparent that the weapon had indeed been fired by the appellant from a close range and that the blackened portion around the wound had been removed by dr sanjay uppal \\nthe learned state counsel has emphasized that in the light of the admitted position that the accused and the deceased were the only ones present at the time of incident and that the accused had projected a counter story some credible explanation was also expected from him \\nreference has been made to raj kumar prasad tamarkar  s case2007 indlaw sc 5 supra wherein in circumstances surprisingly akin to the present matter this court had the following observations to make the conspectus of the events which had been noticed by the learned sessions judge as also by the high court categorically go to show that at the time when the occurrence took place the deceased and the respondent only were in the bedroom and the terrace connecting the same \\nthere was no other person \\nthe cause of death of the deceased usha devi i e by a gun shot injury is not disputed \\nthe fact that the terrace and the bedroom are adjoining each other is not in dispute \\nthe autopsy report shows that a blackening and charring existed so far as injury no i is concerned \\nthe blackening and charring keeping in view the nature of the firearm which is said to have been used clearly go to show that a shot was fired from a short distance \\nblackening or charring is possible when a shot is fired from a distance of about 2 feet to 3 feet \\nit therefore can not be a case where the death might have been caused by somebody by firing a shot at the deceased from a distance of more than 6 feet \\nthe place of injury is also important \\nthe lacerated wound was found over grabella middle of forehead \\nit goes a long way to show that the same must have been done by a person who wanted to kill the deceased from a short distance \\nthere was thus a remote possibility of causation of such type of injury by any other person who was not in the terrace \\nonce the prosecution has been able to show that at the relevant time the room and terrace were in exclusive occupation of the couple the burden of proof lay upon the respondent to show under what circumstances death was caused to his wife \\nthe onus was on him \\nhe failed to discharge the same \\nwe have considered the submission of the state counsel very carefully \\nit is true that it is generally for the prosecution to prove its case beyond doubt but in circumstances such as the present one some explanation is also due from an accused in order to absolve himself from suspicion of the crime \\nin his statement section p c his positive stand was that he alone had been in the house with mukhtiar kaur when she had been killed and indeed as per exhibit p jj mukhtiar kaur  s body had been found only one karam 5 feet away from the place where the appellant lay injured \\nit must be emphasized that but for this self serving statement made by the appellant there is nothing on record to support his positive stance \\neven otherwise we are of the opinion that had the shot been fired by some intruder the direction would have been more or less horizontal and parallel to the ground and not from down upwards with the pellets hitting the jaw skirting the cheek and hitting the roof at point \\ne in modi  s medical jurisprudence and toxicology 23rd edition at page 765 while dealing with identification of homicidal and suicidal injuries it has been observed that a suicidal firearm wound is usually a contact wound situated on the side of the temple depending on which hand was used to shoot himself in the centre of the forehead the roof of the mouth in the chest or epigastrium in front or the left side and some times under the chin \\nthe firearm is usually fired at close range \\na small weapon like a revolver or a pistol is held in the hand while a rifle or a shot gun is supported on the ground or against the wall \\nsometimes the firing is done by pulling a string tied to the trigger by the big toe \\nthe skin around the entry wound shows characteristic blackening scorching and tattooing \\nin such cases the hand used to steady the weapon at the muzzle may be blackened and scorched and may also be stained with squirting of the blood from the injured arteries \\nin homicidal and accidental shooting the wound may be on any part of the body and the path of the bullet may be in any direction \\nhomicidal shooting by dacoits is not uncommon in india and they are known to make their own firearms \\nimmediate death following a firearm wound is uncommon and even when vital organs are injured a person may be capable of doing extraordinary things \\nsometimes firearm wounds may look like knife slashes or a bullet hole may resemble a penetrating stab wound if the bullet strikes the head of shoulder at an angle or when an unstable bullet registers a broadside hit \\na fateh describes a rare homicidal gun shot wound of the mouth where the entry wound was in the tongue and the direction was horizontally backward while in suicidal wounds the direction is upwards entrance would be in the palate or posterior pharynx \\ndr b r sharma in his book forensic science in criminal investigation and trials fourth edition at page 1160 too has delineated the circumstances that could indicate suicide and while referring to the site of the injury has observed certain sites are predominantly used by suicides for self inflicted injuries \\nfor example with firearm temple forehead mouth and chest are the favourite sites \\nwith knife throat and wrist are the favourite sites \\nhesitation injuries are also observed in some suicide cases \\nit is therefore clear to us that the story of unknown assailants entering the house and causing mukhtiar kaur  s murder etcetera has to be ruled out and that the prosecution story that it was the appellant who had first shot mukhtiar kaur and then attempted to commit suicide stands proved \\nwe also find that no part of the evidence of the hostile witnesses comes to the aid of the appellant \\nthe question now arises as to the sentence that should be imposed on the appellant \\nit would be seen that both the sessions court and the high court were appalled by the allegations and findings of incestuous rape and murder \\nwe are however of the opinion as already noted above that a case of rape has not been made out \\nin this background the death sentence is not called for \\nwe accordingly acquit the appellant of the charge section 376 of the ipc but maintain his conviction for the other offences but commute his death sentence to life \\nwith this modification the appeal is dismissed \\nappeal dismissed \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"expected_output\",\n

centrifugal pumps also under the mark  field marshall  allegedly on the premise that the first respondent is the proprietor of the said mark by reason of long user and thus acquired a reputation in that behalf a legal notice was issued upon it questioning its right to use the said mark in respect of centrifugal pumps by the appellant laying a claim that it had been using the said mark since 1963  respondent no 1 thereafter filed a suit in the delhi high court for grant of a decree of permanent injunction being suit no 2408 of 1985 alleging infringement of the said mark and or claiming right of passing off in respect thereof  an ex parte order of injunction was passed on 19 12 1985 against the defendant  meanwhile a temporary ex parte injunction is issued against the defendants restraining them from manufacturing or selling either themselves or through any dealer or representative diesel oil engines or parts thereof with the trade mark  field marshal  and or any other trade mark identical therewith and all goods falling in cl 7 of the trade and merchandise mark rules  the second rectification application filed by the first respondent however was transferred to the intellectual property appellate board  the said application was dismissed  a writ petition was filed there against by the first respondent  a learned single judge of the delhi high court however refused to stay the operation of the order of the board dated 27 10 2004 an appeal was preferred there against  the division bench of the high court thereafter while disposing of both the writ petition and the letters patent appeal allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of the board and directed it to adjudicate the dispute on merits  the said order of the division bench is under challenge in this appeal   argument appellant s counsel appeared on that date and inter alia contended that presently it was the registered owner of the trade mark which was sought to be cancelled  in view of that statement a submission was made on behalf of the first respondent that it may be permitted to withdraw the petition with liberty to file a fresh petition on the same cause of action   issue whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case the application under s 46 1  b  was maintainable  whether  to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps  goods  so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned   analysis the core question which arises for our consideration is as to whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case the application under s 46 1  b  was maintainable  indisputably the scope of the provisions for removal from register in terms of s 46 and 56 of the act stand on different footings  whereas s 46 had a limited application s 56 of the act is wider in nature  concededly cl  a  of sub s  1  of s 46 is not attracted in the case  the prayer in the application was to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps  goods  so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned  it is in the aforementioned situation it is advisable to determine the meaning of the words  for the time being  occurring in s 46 1  b  of the act  two interpretations thereto which are possible are   1  the said words would denote non use of the trade mark in relation to the goods by the appellant for a period of five years or longer  and  2  the mark had not been used for a period of five years or longer either by the present proprietor thereof or his predecessor  the words  for the time being  would mean differently in different situations  it may mean  the moment or existing position  as was held by this court in the case of jivendra nath kaul v  collector district magistrate and anr   1992  3 scc 576 1992 indlaw sc 1107  or in the context of cl  22  of art 366 of the constitution as has been held in h h maharajadhiraja  madhav rao jivaji rao scindia bahadur of gwalior h h maharajadhiraja  maharana shri bhagwat singhji bahadur of udaipur v  union of india and anr  air 1971  sc 530 1970

with authority to recognize or not to recognize a ruler arbitrarily   the expression  for them time being  predicts that there shall be a ruler of the indian state that if the first recognized ruler dies or ceases to be a ruler a successor shall be appointed and that there shall not be more rulers than one at a given time  the person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods as that of the registered owner  it confers an exclusive right of use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in which the trade mark is registered  whether s 46 1  b  read with s 48 of the act would bring within its purview not only a registered proprietor but also the proprietor who had otherwise acquired a right would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case  the court while construing a statute takes into consideration the parliamentary intent in amending the provisions thereof  it seeks to enhance the period of moratorium of use of the registered trade mark from one month to three months so as to prevent speculative assignment  thus a case of speculative assignment is specifically required to be made out  such an application may be maintainable in terms of s 56 of the act but strictly not in terms of s 46 1  b  thereof and that too in the absence of the original registered proprietor  attention has again been drawn to a passage from  law of trade marks    geographical indications  by shri k c kailasam wherein the judgment of the tribunal has been criticized in the following terms    from the above legislative intent it would seem that the period of non use of the trade mark is to be reckoned continuously from the date of its registration  in the case of american home products corporation v  mac laboratories pvt ltd  rendered under the 1958 act it was held by the supreme court that  the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the register has only to prove  such continuous non user   it would appear that neither the u k act nor the indian act at any time envisaged that the commencement of 5 year period of non use is to be delinked from the date of registration of the mark so as to give a fresh lease of life to the registration every time there is change in the ownership of the mark  if that be so any registered proprietor could easily defeat an application for rectification by assigning the mark to some other person to have a fresh period of 5 years from the date of assignment and thus effectively frustrate the very object of the provision in s 47 1  a  and  b   further it is to be noted that an assignment is subject to  the provisions of the act and any rights vested in any other person   see  s 37  the assignor cannot obviously transfer more rights than he himself has to the assignee under the act  an assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses   statute interpretation of the provisions of s 46 1  b   and section 48 of the trade and merchandise marks act 1958  \",\n          \"facts tata consultant engineers was a partnership firm but subsequently the partnership was dissolved and in 1974 the undertaking became one of the divisions of tata sons limited  it functions as a consulting organisation and a service industry and does not manufacture any product or carry on trade its work force consists of engineers and supervisors and different categories of workmen  the tata consultant employees union served a charter of demands in july 1974 on the appellant and as their demands were not accepted and conciliation proceedings proved fruitless the state government made a reference of the dispute under s 10 1  d  industrial tribunal maharashtra for adjudication  the union filed a statement before the tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments  it was urged that the efficiency bar as a feature of the wage scales should be removed  the dearness allowance it was claimed should be granted on a slab system  the claim of the union was resisted by the appellant who maintained that the existing wage scales were fair and reasonable on a region cum industry basis and that it would not be possible for the appellant to bear the additional financial burden if the demands of the union were accepted  the appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised  there was no separate dearness allowance until january 1977 when it was introduced for the first time  house rent allowance was also paid  dearness allowance became payable at 10  of the basic wage subject to a minimum of rs 50  and house rent allowance at 30  of the basic salary  the tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years there was definite need for revising the wage scales  it also laid down the principle enabling the actual fitment of the workmen in their respective wage scales as on that date and also provided for the number of increments to which they would be entitled having regard to the period of completed service  two days after the award was made an application was made by the union stating   in the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22 in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance   the workmen have filed an appeal by special leave  in which they have challenged the rejection by the tribunal of their claim in respect of dearness allowance which they contend should be pegged to the cost of living index and should not be a fixed amount   argument considering the appeal of tata consulting engineers first the contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal erred in making the wage scales retrospective and in any event in ranging the retrospectivity back to 1st january 1976  the learned counsel for the appellant had covered a wide field but in the end he states that the appellant is aggrieved by two matters only  one is the retrospectivity attached to the revised wage scales and the other is the flat increase given to each employee of rs 150  in the category of draughtsmen and rs 100  in other categories resulting from the order dated 22nd december 1978  it is urged that the amendment results in the inclusion of a flat increase of rs 150  to each workman in the case of draughtsman and rs 100  to each workman in the case of other categories a result wholly unwarranted it is said by the intent of the original award and therefore falling beyond the jurisdiction of the tribunal  the only contention of the workmen is that the tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index   issue the primary and basic question considered by the industrial tribunal in making the award dated december 20 1978 was the question of revision of the wage scales  implicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage scales and flat or ad hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary   analysis it must be remembered that although the wage scales were introduced as long ago as 1973 they were maintained at that level except for a slight revision some time thereafter  no dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time  the cost of living had gone on increasing from 1972 onwards and as the tribunal has found the dearness allowance and house rent allowance made no appreciable impact in neutralising the increasing cost  during all these years the appellant had continued to enjoy increasing profits  nonetheless the emoluments received by the workmen did not receive the impress of the appellant s growing prosperity  the charter of demands was presented by the union in july 1974 and when conciliation proceedings failed the state government made the reference to the industrial tribunal in 1975  they are considerations which cannot be ignored  accordingly the contention raised on behalf of the appellant against retrospectivity of the wage scales must be rejected  the financial capacity of the appellant and the related study of its annual profits from 1968 to 1977 were examined from that view point  the sufficiency of the existing pay scales was considered in detail and regard was had to their original structure and the accretions made subsequently by way of dearness allowance and house rent allowance  for the purpose of restructuring the pay scales the tribunal ruled on the paying capacity of the appellant both with reference to the profits of the preceding year as well as the prospects of the future  the financial capacity as the tribunal observed constituted one of  the principles which are required to be followed in the fixation of the wage structure   no ad hoc increase to the pay of each individual workman was intended  the jurisdiction given to the tribunal by rule 31 is closely circumscribed  it is only a clerical mistake or error which can be corrected and the clerical mistake or error must arise from an accidental slip or omission in the award  an accidental slip or omission implies that something was intended and contrary to that intention what should not have been included has been included or what should have been included has been omitted  it must be a mistake or error amenable to clerical correction only  it must not be a mistake or error which calls for rectification by modification of the conscious adjudication on the issues involved  the omission of the words to each employee first after the figure rs 150  and again after the figure rs 100  was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the tribunal was entitled to correct  it will be noted that the pay scales of different categories were being restructured and the flat increase envisaged there related to an increase in the general pay scales of different categories  individual workmen were not present to the mind of the tribunal  that the increase was pertinent to the general pay scales in the revised wage structure is patently clear from a comparison of the existing pay scales and the revised pay scales  the comparative table of existing pay scales and the revised pay scales has been reproduced earlier  the revised pay scales of all categories except the category of draughtsmen shows an increase of rs 100  in the initial pay fixed in each scale the increase in the case of the category of draughtsmen being rs 150   the amendment made by the tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase this time to each individual workmen  if as the tribunal has stated in the amendment order the increase in paragraph 23 was intended to apply to each individual workmen there is nothing in the body of the award to form the foundation on which the actual figures in the restructured pay scales can be made to rest  there will be no explanation why the initial start of the revised pay scales has been increased by rs 150  in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100  in the case of other categories  considering the fitment of the workman in the revised scales it was stated in the award that a workman found drawing a salary less than the beginning of the grade would be stepped up to the beginning of the grade and if his pay fell between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay was to be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale  reliance was placed on the hindustan times ltd  new delhi v their workmen  1964  1 scr 234 1962 indlaw sc 436 247 where it was observed by this court that dearness allowance should not remain fixed at any figure but should be on a sliding scale in order to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living  now it is not a universal rule that the dearness allowance should in all cases be correlated with the cost of living index  it was open to the tribunal to adopt the position which it did  if the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered  the award is a composite document in which the several elements of increased wage scales larger increments longer span of 20 years for earning increments dearness allowance at 10  of the basic wage besides several other benefits have been integrated into a balanced arrangement in keeping with what the tribunal has found to be the financial capacity of the appellant  it is not possible to maintain one part of the award and supersede another  conspicuous by its absence is any reference to a flat increase in the pay of an individual workmen  we are not impressed with the submission that the corrigendum was in effect a fresh award  we therefore see no ground for quashing the of the tribunal  dearness allowance linked to cost of living index is ordinarily the best and the most scientific method of computing dearness allowance it cannot always be said that an illegality warranting interference under article 136 is committed if some other method is adopted  the tribunal has given satisfactory reason for adopting a different mode and we are not disposed to interfere with the award of the tribunal   statute in making the application of 22nd december 1978 the union invoked the jurisdiction of the tribunal under rule 31 of the industrial disputes  bombay  rules 1957  rule 31 provides  the labour court tribunal or arbitrator may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any award it or he issues  the application before the

ujjagar singh  the appellant herein  was tried and convicted by the additional sessions judge  sangrur for the murder of his niece mukhtiar kaur and was awarded the death penalty  in addition  he was convicted for an offence punishable u s  376 of the ipc and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to a fine of rs 5  000   and in default of payment to undergo further r i  for one year and u s  309 of the ipc to a sentence of simple imprisonment for one year  the aforesaid convictions and sentences have been maintained by the high court and the matter is before us in these proceedings by way of special leave  at about 2 00 p m  on 10th november 2002 a boy whose identity is not forthcoming  informed satnam singh pw2 that an incident of firing had taken place in the house of ujjagar singh   satnam singh conveyed this information to sarpanch jora singh pw1 who was attending a marriage at that time  jora singh accompanied by gurdeep singh pw3 thereupon rushed to ujjagar singh s house and found mukhtiar kaur lying dead with a gun shot injury and the appellant also with a gun shot injury lying unconscious on the ground in the adjoining room  it appears that mukhtiar kaur s relations with her in laws had got strained and she had left her matrimonial home and come to live with ujjagar singh  her uncle  7 or 8 months earlier and the suggestion was that mukhtiar kaur had been killed by the appellant with his licensed gun and he had thereafter attempted to commit suicide   argument the learned counsel for the accused has raised several arguments in the course of hearing  he has pointed out that there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that mukhtiar kaur had been subjected to rape and in this view of the matter the very basis for the imposition of the death penalty was not made out  he has also pointed out that there were no eye witnesses to the incident and the 4 witnesses i e  jora singh and others who had reached the place of incident and carried the injured appellant to the hospital had also resiled and as the prosecution story now rested on circumstantial evidence alone  it was imperative for the investigating officer to have taken the finger prints from the weapon and that in any case the recovery of the spent cartridges and the gun were clearly suspicious as the weapon had been sent to the laboratory after an inordinate delay  it has also been submitted that in a case of attempted suicide a firearm must of necessity be used from a very close range and the absence of any blackening  charring or burning around the wound on ujjagar singh clearly ruled out the possibility of such an attempt  it has finally been submitted that the land had been transferred in the name of ujjagar singh s sons in the year 1994 by gurmail kaur  mother of mukhtiar kaur by a collusive decree and there was no evidence to show that mukhtiar kaur had ever displayed any unhappiness or made any complaint to any person or any authority with regard to the decree and as such  the very basis of the prosecution story did not exist  he had laid great emphasis on the fact that no reference to the gun or cartridges had been made in the inquest report and that in any case the weapon and the spent cartridges had been sent to the laboratory belatedly   issue convictions and sentences by the high court should be maintained or not   analysis from the medical evidence and from the chemical examiner s reports that the vaginal swab and clothes taken from the dead body did indicate the presence of semen  there is however absolutely no evidence to suggest  even assuming that the intercourse had been committed by the appellant  that he had done so without mukhtiar kaur s consent or against her will  it is also significant that the investigators had made no attempt whatsoever to have the appellant medically examined to ascertain his capacity to perform sexual intercourse  it must nonetheless be emphasized that whether a chain is complete or not would depend on the facts of each case emanating from the evidence and no universal yardstick should ever be attempted  it is in this background that we must examine the circumstances in the present case  a few facts stand out from the prosecution story  first  the place of incident being adjoining rooms in the residential house of the appellant and the fact that the alleged murder weapon is his licensed dbbl gun is proved on record  the evidence also reveals that the appellant was living in the premises along with his wife  mother and son  and two daughters  who were studying outside the village  were frequent visitors  but it is the admitted position that nobody but the appellant and the deceased were present at the time of incident  it is also clear from the evidence that the two spent cartridge cases recovered  one from near mukhtiar kaur s dead body  and the second from the right barrel of the gun lying near the appellant had been sent to the forensic science laboratory which opined that one of the cartridges had been fired from the gun and the other could have been fired therefrom  it is true that in a case relating to circumstantial evidence motive does assume great importance but to say that the absence of motive would dislodge the entire prosecution story is perhaps giving this one factor an importance which is not due and  to use the clichi  the motive is in the mind of the accused and can seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy  there is however a hint in the testimony of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh that his enquiries had revealed that the accused was having illicit relations with mukhtiar kaur and we can assume that some thing untoward had happened which could have triggered the volatile and hostile incident  there could perhaps be some truth in this suggestion  as it is significant that though the appellant had an extended family living with him i e  mother  wife  son living  in the village  and two young daughters who were studying outside and residing in a hostel  but were frequent visitors home  yet none of them has come forth to depose in his favour  therefore  this is yet another circumstance inculpating the accused  it is also significant that the shot had apparently travelled upwards skirting the mandible  through the flesh of the cheek in an upward direction with minimal damage to the bone structure and it is indeed providential that the appellant got away with only an injury  albeit a very serious one  the fact that the shot was fired from below going upwards is also supported by the site plan exh  pjj wherein marks of a shot hitting the roof were seen at point e whereas the appellant was found lying at point d in the same room  it is therefore apparent that the weapon had indeed been fired by the appellant from a close range and that the blackened portion around the wound had been removed by dr  sanjay uppal  it is true that it is generally for the prosecution to prove its case beyond doubt but in circumstances such as the present one  some explanation is also due from an accused in order to absolve himself from suspicion of the crime  no part of the evidence of the hostile witnesses comes to the aid of the appellant  the question now arises as to the sentence that should be imposed on the appellant  it would be seen that both the sessions court and the high court were appalled by the allegations and findings of incestuous rape and murder  we are however of the opinion  as already noted above  that a case of rape has not been made out  in this background the death sentence is not called for   statute section 376  309 of ipc  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

the prescribed manner who shall upon receipt of such notice rectify the register accordingly \\nthe power to rectify the register conferred by this section shall include the power to remove a trade

\\nwhereas s 46 had a limited application s 56 of the act is wider in nature \\nconcededly cl a of sub s 1 of s 46 is not attracted in the case \\nfor the purpose of appreciation of the rival contentions we may notice the findings of the board as also the high court \\nthe board has taken the view that the period of five years and one month will begin to run from the date on which thukral became the proprietor of the trademark that is30th may1986 and therefore the rectification application could have been filed by the appellant only sometime in 1991 opining that an application for rectification against the appellant within a period of seven and a half months from the date of assignment of the trade mark was not maintainable the application was dismissed \\nthe high court on the other hand opined it was not anybody  s case before us that m s jain industries \\nthe registered proprietor of the trademark used it at all \\nthe trademark was used by the appellant and thukral neither of whom were proprietors thereof except that thukral claims to have become its proprietor with effect from 30th may1986 according to learned counsel for the appellant the use of the trademark by thukral was not legally permissible use inasmuch as thukral did not have the consent tacit or otherwise of m s jain industries to use the trademark \\nif thukral did then it can not be said that there was no bona fide use thereof by its proprietor \\nthat is m s jain industries \\nthis appears to be the position at least till 30th may1986 in \\nthe meantime as a result of the ex parte ad interim injunction granted on 19th december 1985 by this court in suit no 2408 of 1985there was no question of thukral using the trademark field marshal till the injunction was vacated on 19th january1988 \\nthe act was enacted to provide for the registration and better protection of trademarks and for the prevention of the use of fraudulent marks of merchandise \\nregistration of a trade

is required under the act \\nfirst respondent withdrew the application against m s jain industries \\nthe prayer in the application was to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps goods so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned \\nit is in the aforementioned situation we are called upon to determine the meaning of the words for the time being occurring in s 461b of the act \\ntwo interpretations thereto which are possible are 1 the said words would denote non use of the trade mark in relation to the goods by the appellant for a period of five years or longer and 2 the mark had not been used for a period of five years or longer either by the present proprietor thereof or his predecessor \\nwe may however also notice that another construction of the said provision has been put forth by mr sunderam learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that the word proprietor would not mean a registered proprietor but also a person who has become proprietor by long use thereof \\nthe words for the time being would mean differently in different situations \\nit may mean the moment or existing position as was held by this court in the case of jivendra nath kaul v collector district magistrate and anr 1992 \\n3 scc 576 1992 indlaw sc 1107 or in the context of cl 22 of art 366 of the

entire period of five years or more irrespective of the fact as to whether the registered proprietor was one or more than one as has been held by the high court \\nthere can not be any doubt or dispute that the registration of a trade mark confers a very valuable right \\nthe person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods as that of the registered owner \\nit confers an exclusive right of use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in which the trade mark is registered \\nthe same is an assignable right in terms of s 36 of the act whereas an unregistered trade mark is not \\nuser of the said mark therefore entails the consequences laid down under cl b of sub s 1 of s 46 \\nhowever such an application can be filed only by a person aggrieved \\nwhen the applicant before the board establishes the fact in regard to non user of the mark for a period of more than five years on the part of the registered owner the latter may show that his case falls within the purview of sub s 3 of s 46 \\nthe question which therefore arises is as to who can prove that he had the bona fide intention to use the trade mark on the date of application for registration \\nindisputably it would be the registered proprietor \\ns 46 is a penal provision \\nit provides for civil or evil consequences \\nit takes away the valuable right of a registered proprietor \\nit therefore can be taken away only when the conditions laid down therefor are satisfied \\nwhile we say so we are not oblivious of the fact that trafficking in trade mark is to be discouraged \\na registered proprietor of a trade mark should not be permitted to circumvent the law of user of the trade mark for a long time by assigning the same from time to

a proprietor thereof by user is supposed to keep itself abreast with such applications filed by another either for registration of the trade mark or renewal thereof \\nthe non user for a long time would disentitle a registered proprietor from renewal of the registration \\nit must not however be forgotten that s 461b provides for a special remedy \\nas a person obtains a right on and from the date of registration andor renewal thereof he can ordinarily be deprived of his right unless it is shown that the assignment thereof by his holder was not a bona fide one or had been made by way of camouflage \\nif the assignee has obtained assignment for bona fide use he may not be fastened with any liability owing to non user on the part of his predecessor \\nin other words the mistake of the predecessor should not be visited with non use of the present registered owner \\nit must however be observed that whether a use is for bona fide purpose would essentially be a question of fact \\nwhether s 461b read with s 48 of the act would bring within its purview not only a registered proprietor but also the proprietor who had otherwise acquired a right would depend upon the facts and

of injunction was vacated \\nfor one reason or the other the said order attained finality \\nprima facie therefore appellant has been held to be the registered owner of the trade mark \\nit is one thing to say that for the purpose of frustrating an application for rectification the appellant had colluded with its predecessor for the purpose of trafficking by entering into the deed of assignment which is otherwise illegal and bad in law \\nbut it is another thing to say that the appellant could be proceeded against alone for non user of the registered trade mark for a period of more than five years \\nfor the purpose of making out such a case both the original registrants as also the assignee were required to be impleaded as parties \\nwe may at this stage notice that in law of trade marks by mr k c kailasam while commenting on s 47 of the trade marks act1999 to which our attention has been drawn by mr sudhir chandra it is stated \\nnotes on clauses \\nthis clause corresponds to s 46 of the existing act and provides for removal of a trade mark from the register on the ground of non use \\na trade mark which is not used within five years of its registration becomes liable for removal either completely or in respect of those goods or services for which the mark has not been used \\nunder s 461it is proposed to clarify that the five years period will start from the date on which the trade mark is actually entered on the register \\nthis amendment is intended to remove any ambiguity as for all other purposes the date of registration will be the date on which the application was filed vide cl 232 proviso to sub cl 1 also provides that the tribunal may refuse removal of the mark if it is shown that any proprietor had in fact made bona fide use of the trademark for goods or services of the same description or associated goods or services \\nit is also proposed to increase the period from 1 to 3 months in cl 471a and b in which use of the trade mark prior to the date of filing of the application for removal of the trade mark shall be disregarded \\nthis is intended to prevent the registered proprietor to by pass the act by such token use after he comes to know that an application for removal is about to be filed sub cl 3 protects a mark from being removed from the register on ground of non use if such non use is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade \\nthe clause is proposed to be modified to clarify that special circumstances in the trade will include restrictions imposed by any law or regulation on the use of trade mark in india \\nconsequential amendments have been made to cover services cl 47 of the bill \\nthe court while construing a statute takes into consideration the parliamentary intent in amending the provisions thereof \\nit seeks to enhance the period of moratorium of use of the registered trade mark from one month to three months so as to prevent speculative assignment \\nthus a case of speculative assignment is specifically required to be made out \\nsuch an application may be maintainable in terms of s 56 of the act but strictly not in terms of s 461b thereof and that too in the absence of the original registered proprietor \\nwe are not satisfied with the explanation offered by the first respondent that it gave up the case of non use of the registered trade mark against m s jain industries on the basis of statement made by the learned counsel for the appellant firstly because consent does not confer jurisdiction secondly because want andor lack of jurisdiction on the part of the tribunal can not be waived as if any order is passed without jurisdiction the same would be a nullity and thirdly because the cause of action even according to the first respondent in his application before the high court was different \\nthe counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant did not state that it had waived its right so far as non impleadment of m s jain industries was concerned \\nit only consented for grant of liberty in favour of the first respondent for filing of an application for the self same cause of action \\nthe question of maintainability of the second suit is absence of the registrant proprietor was not and could not have been the subject matter of consent at that stage \\nthe cause of action which permitted the first respondent to file an application for rectification against m s jain industries was non user thereof by it \\nits non user and rectification of the register could not in the aforementioned situation have been tagged with the cause of action if any against the appellant \\nthe second contention of mr that the appellant was an infringer of the trade mark is again a question of fact \\nthe right of the first respondent as a proprietor of the trade mark by reason of a long user is required to be determined vis  vis m s jain industries as also the appellant in the suit filed by it which is pending \\nthe board could not while exercising its jurisdiction under s 461bof the act proceeded on the basis of such presumption \\nit is not correct that no cause of action survived against jain industries \\nit was not lost by reason of assignment as was contended by the learned counsel \\nin the suit only the competing right of the first respondent qua the appellant can be determined and not a right against m s such a right can not be determined in a proceeding under s 461b of the act which is restricted to non user of the registered trade mark \\nboth the appellant and the respondent no 1 were the infringers of the right of m s jain industries as it was the registered proprietor of the trade mark in respect of the goods in question namely centrifugal pumps \\ntwo interpretations of the said provision s 461b are possible \\nwhile interpreting the same however certain basic principles of construction of statute must be kept in mind \\nas it takes away somebody  s right it deserves strict construction \\njurisdiction of the board being dependent on determination of the foundational facts the same was required to be established on the basis of the averments made in the application and not otherwise \\nthe right of a registered trade mark is not lost automatically on the expiry of five years and one month \\nit does not provide for a sun set law \\nit has to be adjudicated upon \\nwhether the registered proprietor of the trade mark had taken recourse to trafficking or not must be determined in an appropriate proceeding \\nthe principle of purchaser of a property has a duty to make enquiriestherefore cannot apply in a case of this nature \\nso long as the right to assign a registered trade mark remains valid once the same is validly assigned the assignee derives the same right as that of the assignor in terms of the statute \\na title to a trade mark derived on assignment as provided for under the act can not be equated with a defective title acquired in any other property as admittedly on the date of assignment the right of the registered trade mark was not extinguished \\nboth the findings of the high court which we have noticed hereinbefore are findings on question of law and in that view of the matter the contention of mr sudhir chandra that the merit of the matter is yet to be gone into by the board can not be a ground for ignoring the submissions made at the bar \\nour attention has again been drawn to a passage from law of trade marks geographical indications by shri k c kailasam wherein the judgment of the tribunal has been criticized in the following terms from the above legislative intent it would seem that the period of non use of the trade mark is to be reckoned continuously from the date of its registration \\nin the case of american home products corporation v mac laboratories pvt ltd \\nrendered under the 1958 act it was held by the supreme court that the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the register has only to prove \\nsuch continuous non user \\nit would appear that neither the u k act nor the indian act at any time envisaged that the commencement of 5 year period of non use is to be delinked from the date of registration of the mark so as to give a fresh lease of life to the registration every time there is change in the ownership of the mark \\nif that be so any registered proprietor could easily defeat an application for rectification by assigning the mark to some other person to have a fresh period of 5 years from the date of assignment and thus effectively frustrate the very object of the provision in s 471a and b further it is to be noted that an assignment is subject to the provisions of the act and any rights vested in any other person see \\ns 37 the assignor can not obviously transfer more rights than he himself has to the assignee under the act \\nwe do not think that the approach of the learned author is entirely correct \\nan assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses \\nif his title is not extinguished by reason of a provision of a statute for non user of the trade mark for a period of five years any assignment made shall be valid subject to such situation which we have noticed in paragraph 25 supra \\nfor the views we have taken we are of the opinion that the impugned judgment can not be sustained \\nit is set aside accordingly \\nthe board shall however proceed to determine afresh the application filed by the first in the light of the legal principles explained above \\nthe appeal is allowed with costs \\ncounsel  s fee assessed at rs 100000 \\nappeal allowed \\n\",\n          \"this appeal by special leave has been preferred by tata consultancy engineers against an award dated 20th december1978 of the industrial tribunal maharashtra bombay revising the wage scales of certain categories of employees and granting various other benefits \\ntata consultant engineers at its inception was a partnership firm but subsequently the partnership was dissolved and in 1974 the undertaking became one of the divisions of tata sons limited \\nit functions as a consulting organisation and a service industry and does not manufacture any product or carry on trade \\nits work force consists of engineers and supervisors and different categories of workmen \\nout of 665 employees at bombay the draftsmen and the administrative staff number 306 these workmen are members of the tata consultant employees union \\nthey served a charter of demands in july1974on the appellant and as their demands were not accepted and conciliation proceedings proved fruitless the state government made a reference of the dispute under s 101 dindustrial tribunal maharashtra for adjudication \\nthe reference was numbered i t no 292 of 1975 \\nthe union filed a statement before the tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments \\nit was urged that the efficiency bar as a feature of the wage scales should be removed \\nthe dearness allowance it was claimed should be granted on a slab system \\nthe claim of the union was resisted by the appellant who maintained that the existing wage scales were fair and reasonable on a region cum industry basis and that it would not be possible for the appellant to bear the additional financial burden if the demands of the union were accepted \\nreference was made to the political uncertainty in iran which had placed an appreciable part of the appellant  s business in jeopardy and to various other factors peculiar to an engineering consultancy business beyond the appellant  s control \\nthere was fierce competition also it was asserted from other similar organisations \\nthe appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised \\nthere was no separate dearness allowance until january1977 when it was introduced for the first time \\nhouse rent allowance was also paid \\ndearness allowance became payable at 10 of the basic wage subject to a minimum of rs 50 and house rent allowance at 30 of the basic salary \\nnothing those facts the tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years there was definite need for revising the wage scales \\nit was pointed out that the dearness allowance and house rent allowance granted by the appellant made little impact in neutralising the cost of living \\nthe need for revising the wage scales was not disputed by the appellant \\nin proceeding to revise the wage structure the tribunal took into account the two principles involved in the process the financial capacity of the industry to bear the burden of an increased wage bill and the prevailing wage structure on an industry cum region basis \\nwage scale statements were filed by the parties before the tribunal pertaining to several engineering consultancy organisations but \\nin the absence of pertinent information concerning the strength of their labour force the extent of their business the financial position for some years the capital invested the precise nature of the business the position regarding reserves dividends declared and future prospects of the company the tribunal found that it was unable to rely on them as comparable concerns \\nholding it impossible in the circumstances to apply the principle of industry cum region basis the tribunal turned to a consideration of the financial capacity of the company to bear an additional burden in this connection it proceeded on the footing that the appellant was a separate and independent division of tata sons limited and had no functional integrality with the other divisions \\nhaving regard to the net profits earned by the appellant from 1968 to 1977 it found that the acceptance of the demands of the union would result in an increased burden of rs 7 crores a burden which would dry up the appellant  s resources and would be impossible for it to bear \\nthe union modified its demands but even the modified terms according to the tribunal appeared to be on the high side inasmuch as the resulting total burden of rs 1 70 crores was much higher than the average profits could sustain \\nthe particular character of the appellant that it was a service industry and not a manufacturing concern was taken into account and it was observed that unlike a manufacturing business there was little scope for diversification in the case of an engineering consultancy \\nnonetheless the tribunal observed there was every reason to expect that the appellant would be able to earn sound profits in the future and the instability in its business activities occasioned by the turbulent political situation in iran would be it was expected compensated by contracts secured in different developing countries \\nfor the purpose of determining the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal followed unichem laboratories v their workmen 1972 indlaw sc 181 where it was held that the gross profits should be computed without making deductions on account of taxation development rebate and depreciation \\nit decided also that there was no ground for deducting the notional value of gratuity \\nrevising the figures on that basis it computed the annual gross profits for the years 1968 to 1977 and determined the annual average at rs 26 69 lakhs \\nthe tribunal took note of the elaborate scales of wages already existing in the wage structure of the appellant and decided to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category \\nit also observed that the category of draughtsmen needed a special increase \\nbut it rejected the demand of the union for dearness allowance on the basis of a slab system because that would have imposed an unacceptable burden on the appellant  s financial capacity and there was no reason why the existing scheme of dearness allowance should be disturbed when a substantial increase was being made in the level of the basic wage \\ntaking into account the circumstance that besides the staff of 306 workmen represented by the union there were several other employees who would also have to be paid the tribunal considered it fair in paragraph 23 of the award to give a flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories \\nit rejected the demand of the union for abolishing the efficiency bar but the span of 15 years for earning increment was expanded in some grades to 20 years and some adjustments were also made in specific grades \\nthe tribunal also noted that after the salaries of the employees had been fixed in the respective scales senior employees would have to be given some more increments in the new scales according to their completed years of service \\ntaking all these factors into consideration it made an award dated 20th december1978 prescribing the following revision in the existing scales of wages \\nthe tribunal maintained the existing schemes of dearness allowance and house rent allowance and observed that in view of the revised basic wages there would be a resultant increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance \\nthe revised wage scales the tribunal directed should take effect retrospectively from 1st january1976 it also laid down the principle enabling the actual fitment of the workmen in their respective wage scales as on that date and also provided for the number of increments to which they would be entitled having regard to the period of completed service \\ntwo days after the award was made an application was made by the union stating in the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance \\nfurther it appears that the tribunal intended to grant the increase of rs 150 to each draughtsman and rs 100 to all other workmen in their basic pay \\nhowever this is not clearly mentioned anywhere in the award due to accidental slip or omission \\nthe union prayed that the position may be clarified and the award corrected accordingly \\non the same date the tribunal disposed of the application by the following order there can be no doubt that a flat increase of rs 150 to each of the employees in the category of draftsmen and of rs 100 to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award \\nthe same has been made clear in paragraph \\nno 23but it appears that the words to each employee after the figure rs 150 were omitted \\nsimilarly the same words to each employee after the figure 100 were omitted \\nwhen the award is sent for publication a necessary corrigendum be made in the award and the aforesaid words after the figures rs 150 and rs 100 be added \\nit may be mentioned that only from that point of view viz to grant flat increase of rs 150 and of rs 100 to the employees in the category of draftsmen and the other categories respectively that a burden statement was called for from the company and the same was submitted vide exhibit c 51 the fitment has also to be done only after the flat increase is added to the present basic salary of each employee \\ni do not think that any problem would arise for interpretation of the award \\nsince the award has been already signed i do not think anything further can be added to this award \\nsd k n wani industrial tribunal \\nin this appeal the learned counsel for the appellant had covered a wide field but in the end he states that the appellant is aggrieved by two matters only \\none is the retrospectivity attached to the revised wage scales and the other is the flat increase given to each employee of rs 150 in the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in other categories resulting from the order dated 22nd december1978 \\nthe workmen have filed an appeal by special leave civil appeal no 2300 of 1979in which they have challenged the rejection by the tribunal of their claim in respect of dearness allowance which they contend should be pegged to the cost of living index and should not be a fixed amount \\nconsidering the appeal of tata consulting engineers first the contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal erred in making the wage scales retrospective and in any event in ranging the retrospectivity back to 1st january1976 \\nwe have been taken through some of the material on the record in the attempt to support the contention but after giving careful thought to the matter i think there is ample justification for what the tribunal did \\nit must be remembered that although the wage scales were introduced as long ago as 1973 they were maintained at that level except for a slight revision some time thereafter \\nno dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time \\nthe cost of living had gone on increasing from 1972 onwards and as the tribunal has found the dearness allowance and house rent allowance made no appreciable impact in neutralising the increasing cost \\nduring all these years the appellant had continued to enjoy increasing profits nonetheless the emoluments received by the workmen did not receive the impress of the appellant  s growing prosperity \\nthe charter of demands was presented by the union in july1974 and when conciliation proceedings failed the state government made the reference to the industrial tribunal in 1975 the tribunal has referred to various considerations which prevailed with it in giving retrospectivity to the revised pay scales \\nthey are considerations which can not be ignored \\naccordingly the contention raised on behalf of the appellant against retrospectivity of the wage scales must be rejected \\nthe challenge embodied in the second contention against the amendment of the award is more serious \\nit is urged that the amendment results in the inclusion of a flat increase of rs 150 to each workman in the case of draughtsman and rs 100 to each workman in the case of other categories a result wholly unwarranted it is said by the intent of the original award and therefore falling beyond the jurisdiction of the tribunal \\nin making the application of 22nd \\ndecember1978the union invoked the jurisdiction of the \\ntribunal under rule 31 of the industrial disputes bombay rules1957 rule 31 provides the labour court tribunal or arbitrator may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any award it or he issues \\nthe jurisdiction given to the tribunal by rule 31 is closely circumscribed \\nit is only a clerical mistake or error which can be corrected and the clerical mistake or error must arise from an accidental slip or omission in the award \\nan accidental slip or omission implies that something was intended and contrary to that intention what should not have been included has been included or what should have been included has been omitted \\nit must be a mistake or error amenable to clerical correction only \\nit must not be a mistake or error which calls for rectification by modification of the conscious adjudication on the issues involved \\nis the instant case one where the amendment made by the tribunal in the original award can be said to correct a mere clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission \\nto answer the question it is necessary to examine the basis of the award and the intent which flows from that basis \\nthe terms of reference in the state government  s order required the tribunal to revise the scales of pay and dearness allowance and there was no mention of giving any ad hoc increase in the basic pay of individual workman \\nit would do well to recall that the claim of the union filed before the tribunal also centered on the need to revise the wage scales \\nthat was the main issue between the parties \\nit is to the task of revising the pay scales that the tribunal addressed itself and throughout the material part of the award it is that task which held its focussed attention \\nthe financial capacity of the appellant and the related study of its annual profits from 1968 to 1977were examined from that view point \\nthe sufficiency of the existing pay scales was considered in detail and regard was had to their original structure and the accretions made subsequently by way of dearness allowance and house rent allowance \\nfor the purpose of restructuring the pay scales the tribunal ruled on the paying capacity of the appellant both with reference to the profits of the preceding year as well as the prospects of the future \\nthe financial capacity as the tribunal observed constituted one of the principles which are required to be followed in the fixation of the wage structure \\na clear statement of its intention is found in paragraph 22 of the award where the tribunal stated i only propose to modify the existing structures of the scales with flat increases in each category \\nno ad hoc increase to the pay of each individual workman was intended \\nand that is confirmed by what was stated in paragraph 23 of the award considering this outgoing the flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draughtsman and rs 100 in the case of the other categories would be fair \\nit will be noted that the pay scales of different categories were being restructured and the flat increase envisaged there related to an increase in the general pay scales of different categories \\nindividual workmen were not present to the mind of the tribunal \\nthat the increase was pertinent to the general pay scales in the revised wage structure is patently clear from a comparison of the existing pay scales and the revised pay scales \\nthe comparative table of existing pay scales and the revised pay scales has been reproduced earlier \\nthe revised pay scales of all categories except the category of draughtsmen shows an increase of rs 100 in the initial pay fixed in each scale the increase in the case of the category of draughtsmen being rs 150  there was only one increase contemplated in the award in paragraph 23 of award and it is more than plain that the increase was the one incorporated in the revised pay scales pertaining to different categories \\nno second flat increase was envisaged at all \\nthe amendment made by the tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase this time to each individual workmen \\nif as the tribunal has stated in the amendment order the increase in paragraph 23 was intended to apply to each individual workmen there is nothing in the body of the award to form the foundation on which the actual figures in the restructured pay scales can be made to rest \\nthere will be no explanation why the initial start of the revised pay scales has been increased by rs 150 in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories \\nconsidering the fitment of the workman in the revised scales it was stated in the award that a workman found drawing a salary less than the beginning of the grade would be stepped up to the beginning of the grade and if his pay fell between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay was to be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale \\nconspicuous by its absence is any reference to a flat increase in the pay of an individual workmen \\neven when considering the range of permissible retrospectivity the tribunal stated in the award in view of the revision of the wage scales there would be consequent increase in the dearness allowance and the house rent allowance \\nand the clinching circumstances of all is that the award was made on the basis that the overall financial load according to paragraph 33 of the award would be to the tune of about rs 5 lakhs \\nit was that figure which the tribunal had in mind against the backdrop of the gross annual figures when it made the revised pay scales retrospective from 1st \\njanuary1976 this liability taken with the liability accruing on the need to increase the salaries of the other staff determined the tribunal  s deliberations in regard to the several features of the award including the grant of increments related to completed periods of service the expansion of the span from 15 years to 20 years for earning increments and other benefits \\nit can not be the case of the union that the figure of rs 5 lakhs mentioned in paragraph 33 of the award represented the result of adding a flat increase to the pay of each workman in addition to the benefits conferred by the revised pay scales and other awarded reliefs \\nin its order of 22nd \\ndecember1978the tribunal has referred to the statement exhibit c 51 filed by the appellant when called upon to indicate the increased financial burden apprehended by it \\nthe tribunal has relied on this statement as evidence showing that the appellant knew that a flat increase of rs 150 and rs 100 was intended to each of the employees in the category of draughtsmen and the other categories \\nin so construing the statement exhibit c 51the tribunal has grievously erred \\nit seems from a perusal of the document exhibit c 51that it is a statement giving trial figures of the increased financial load on different bases \\non the basis that a sum of rs 150 per month was added to the pay of each draughtsman and a sum of rs 100 was added to the pay of every other workman who belonged to the union staff the financial load would increase to rs 922032  likewise if a flat increase of rs 100 was given to individual workmen of all categories including draughtsmen the increased financial load would total rs 764256  the statement then goes on to indicate that if a flat increase of rs 75 per month were given to individual workmen of all categories the total increase would be rs 578220  again if the flat increase is rs 65 per month to the individual workmen of all categories the additional load would total rs 497772  finally on the basis that the individual draughtsman would be given an increase of rs 75 per month and the individual workmen of other categories rs 50 per month the additional load was calculated at rs 463092  it will be noted that the statement exhibit c 51was prepared on the basis of the employees strength as in december1971 a similar statement was prepared on the basis of the employees strength as in september1978 these statements can not be regarded as evidence that the appellant was cognizant of the intention of the tribunal to provide a flat increase to the pay of each workman \\nthe statement afforded an indication merely of what the additional financial load would be if a flat increase was given to the individual workman on the alternative basis set forth therein \\nnone of the alternatives was actually adopted by the tribunal because when the award was made the tribunal proceeded instead to restructure the wage scales by the addition of rs 150 in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories to the initial pay in the wage scales pertaining to those categories \\nthe addition was integrated as a feature of the wage scales it was not regarded as an addition to the pay of each individual workman \\nit seems that the tribunal was betrayed by a curious confusion in accepting the plea of the union that a flat increase to the pay of each workman was intended in the original wage and consequently it fell into the error of amending the award \\nthe evidence contained in the award throughout provides incontrovertible proof that this flat increase was never originally intended in the award \\nthe amendment has resulted in the tribunal making as it were a supplementary award whereby a further relief is being granted beyond that granted in the original award \\nthe original award was completed and signed by the tribunal and it can not be reopened now except for the limited purpose of rule 31 in travelling outside and beyond the terms of the original award the tribunal has committed a jurisdictional error \\nour attention has been drawn to what purports to be an endorsement by counsel for the appellant on the application dated 22nd december1978 filed by the union before the tribunal to the effect that the appellant would submit to whatever the tribunal decided and it is urged that the appellant is bound by the order made on the application \\nit is an accepted principle that consent by a party can not confer jurisdiction on a court \\nwhat is without jurisdiction will remain so \\nin the circumstances the order of 22nd december1978 is invalid so far as it amends paragraph 23 of the original award \\nthe corrigendum amending the award in consequence is liable to be quashed \\nthe second contention of the appellant is entitled to succeed \\ni shall now consider civil appeal no 2300 of 1979 filed by the workmen \\nthe only contention of the workmen is that the tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index \\nit is wrong in principle it is said to provide a fixed dearness allowance \\nreliance was placed on the hindustan times ltd new delhi v their workmen 1964 1 scr 234 1962 indlaw sc 436247 where it was observed by this court that dearness allowance should not remain fixed at any figure but should be on a sliding scale in order to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living \\nreference was also made to bengal chemical pharmaceutical works limited v its workmen \\n2 scr 113 1968 indlaw sc 183 now it is not a universal rule that the dearness allowance should in all cases be correlated with the cost of living index \\nthe tribunal in the present case considered the matter and found it sufficient and in accord with justice that the wage scales should be restructured with suitable increments provided therein \\nit noted that dearness allowance was being granted by the appellant at 10 of the salary subject to a minimum of rs 50 and house rent allowance at 30 of the basic salary \\nhaving regard to the not inconsiderable improvement in the level of the basic wage it observed that there would be a consequent increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance \\nin view of the increase so secured the tribunal rejected the suggestion that a slab system should be introduced in the dearness allowance or that there should be any other modification of the principle on which dearness allowance was being presently granted \\nit declared that the cumulative effect of an improved wage structure together with dearness allowance operating on a slab system would throw an impossible burden of about rs 1 crore on the financial capacity of the appellant \\nit was open to the tribunal to adopt the position which it did \\nif the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered \\nthe award is a composite document in which the several elements of increased wage scales larger increments longer span of 20 years for earning increments dearness allowance at 10 of the basic wage besides several other benefits have been integrated into a balanced arrangement in keeping with what the tribunal has found to be the financial capacity of the appellant \\nit is not possible to maintain one part of the award and supersede another \\naccordingly the appeal filed by the workmen must fail \\nin the result civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 is allowed in part insofar that the order dated 22nd december1978 of the industrial tribunal maharashtra bombay is quashed to the extent that it modifies the original award dated 20th december1978and the corrigendum made consequent thereto is also quashed \\ncivil appeal no 2300 of 1979 is dismissed \\nthere is no order as to costs \\nchinnappa reddy j we have had the advantage of perusing the judgment prepared by our learned brother pathak j we agree with him that civil appeal no 2300 of 1979 should be dismissed \\nwe also agree with him that civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 should also be dismissed in so far as it relates to the award dated december 201978 however we do not agree with our learned brother that civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 should be allowed in so far as it relates to the order dated december 221978 of the industrial tribunal which purports to correct the award dated december 201978 in our opinion civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 should be dismissed in its entirety \\nwe do not propose to give our reasons to the extent we are in agreement with pathak j and we propose to state our reasons for the disagreement only \\nit is needless to recapitulate all the basic facts which have been set out in the judgment of pathak j the award of the industrial tribunal was made on december 201978 on december 221978 that is to say two days after the award was made and when everything must have been fresh to the minds of the tribunal the respective parties and their advocates the employees union made an application under rule 31 of the industrial disputes bombay rules1957 seeking a correction of an error which it was claimed had crept into the award \\nthe application was as follows in the above reference your honour was pleased to pass an award on 20th december1978 \\nin the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance \\nfurther it appears that the tribunal intended to grant the increase of rs 150 to each draughtsman and rs 100 to all other workmen in their basic pay \\nthe union therefore prays the honourable tribunal to clarify the position and correct the award accordingly \\non this application the advocate for the employer company made the following endorsement submitted to whatever this honourable tribunal desires to do \\nthereafter the tribunal made an order on the same day in the following terms there can be no doubt that a flat increase of rs 150 to each of the employees in the category of draftsmen and of rs 100 to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award \\nthis order was made in the presence of shri manak gagrat advocate for the company and shri n p mehta advocate for the workmen \\nthe endorsement made on the application by the advocate for the company does not indicate that the company had any objection to the award being corrected as sought by the employees union \\non the other hand the endorsement reads as if there was tacit agreement on the part of the company to the correction sought by the union \\nthe order dated december 221978 of the tribunal also does not reveal that there was any opposition by the company to the application for correcting the award \\neven so we propose to examine whether the correction sought by the employees union was within the bounds of the authority of the tribunal or whether it was in effect a fresh award \\nthe primary and basic question considered by the industrial tribunal in making the award dated december 201978 was the question of revision of the wage scales \\nimplicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage scales and flat or ad hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary \\nit can not possibly be doubted that an industrial tribunal deciding upon the wage scales of the employees of an establishment would have full liberty to propose ad hoc increase of salaries as part of the revision of wages \\nnor can it be doubted that fitment into the revised pay scales is certainly a part of the revision of pay scales \\nthis in our opinion is elementary and fundamental to the jurisdiction of the industrial tribunal in revising wage scales \\nin the present case the industrial tribunal on a consideration of the material placed before it came to the conclusion that the company was in an undoubted position to bear the additional financial burden \\nat the end of paragraph 15 of the award the tribunal stated but there can be no doubt that the company can very well bear the additional burden \\nthe question is what should be the extent of such burden \\nat the end of paragraph 18 of the award the tribunal said a mere reading of exhibit u 15 will immediately dispel the misgivings about the future of the present company \\nfor some years to come this is likely to be one of the few consulting engineers who will be securing major contracts \\nagain in paragraph 19 it was said i have no doubt that the present company would be able to bear the additional burden for the years to come \\nthis is further borne out from the trading results of the company for the year 1968 69 to 1977 the profits have increased all along \\nthe copy of the letter dated july 231973alongwith \\nthe annexures from the company to the director general posts telegraphs delhi ex \\nc 27 indicates the important projects the company was handling in india and abroad and the amount of foreign exchange earned and repatriated \\ni will therefore proceed on the ground that the present company can bear the additional financial burden \\nfinally at the end of paragraph 21 \\nthe tribunal said in view of this position the company can easily bear some burden that might fall as a result of the upward revision of the wage scales \\nthe question is to what extent the relief should be given to the employees \\nafter expressing himself in categoric terms about the capacity of the company to bear the additional financial burden the tribunal went on to say i only propose to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category \\nthe tribunal then considered the question whether draftsmen should get a higher flat increase and the question whether the existing scheme of dearness allowance should be revised \\nthe tribunal then observed the flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draftsmen and rs 100 in the case of the other categories would be fair \\nthereafter various other matters were considered and finally the tribunal revised the wage scales in the manner already mentioned by my brother pathak j the question of fitment was then considered in the following manner fitment if as on 1st january1976an employee is drawing a salary less than the beginning of the respective grade he should be first stepped up to the beginning of the grade \\nif the pay of an employee does not coincide with any step in the revised pay scale and falls between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay of that employee shall be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale \\nafter fixing the salary of the employees in the scales as above the employees should be given increments in the new scales as noted below i employees who have completed 5 years or more as on 1st january19763 increments \\nii employees who have completed 4 years of service as on 1st january19762 increments \\nall other employees with more than one year  s service shall be given one increment \\nnow if without any flat or ad hoc increase of salary the workmen were to be fitted into the revised scales of pay it would obviously result in serious anomalous situations \\nin the case of several senior employees the revised scale would yield but a very small and almost a token increase in the size of the pay packet whereas the junior employees would get a large benefit \\nwhile workmen raising industrial disputes for revision of wage scales are certainly minded about their future prospects in the matter of wages they surely would be more concerned with the immediate benefits according to them \\nthat was why the industrial tribunal thought that an all round flat increase of rs 150 in the case of draftsmen and rs 100 in the case of other workmen was called for \\nit was clearly so intended by the tribunal as is evident from the reference to flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draftsmen and rs 100 in the case of the other categories \\nsince there was to be a flat increase of rs 150 and rs 100 in the case of draftsmen and other workmen respectively the revised wage scale had necessarily to commence with figures rs 150 and rs 100 above the existing wage scales \\nimmediately after the award was pronounced while the iron was still hot as it were the employees apparently realised that the employer might take advantage of the circumstance that it was not clearly mentioned in the award that all the employees were to get additional pay of rs 150 and rs 100 respectively and might contend that the tribunal had only revised the wage scales by increasing the salary on entry into the service and restructuring the scale of pay and never granted any ad hoc increase of salary to all employees \\ntherefore they filed an application before the tribunal for correcting the award so as to bring out what was intended \\nas it has now turned out what the employees apparently suspected the employer might contend is precisely what the employer is not contending though the employer did not choose to so contend before the industrial tribunal itself when the employees filed the application for rectification \\nthe application before the tribunal was filed under rule 31 of the bombay industrial disputes rules 1957which is as follows \\na board court labour court tribunal or arbitrator may at any time suo moto or on an application made by any of the parties concerned may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any proceedings report award or as the case may be decision \\nthe omission of the words to each employee first after the figure rs 150 and again after the figure rs 100 was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the tribunal was entitled to correct \\nwe are unable to see how it can be held to be otherwise \\nwe are not impressed with the submission of the learned counsel for the company that the corrigendum was in effect a fresh award \\nwe therefore see no ground for quashing the order dated december 221978 of the tribunal \\nthe result of the foregoing discussion is that civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 has to be dismissed in its entirety \\nwe have already indicated that we agree with our brother pathak j that the appeal civil appeal no 2300 of 1979 filed by the workmen should also be dismissed \\nwhile we find lot of force in the submission of shri v m tarkunde learned counsel for the workmen that dearness allowance linked to cost of living index is ordinarily the best and the most scientific method of computing dearness allowance it can not always be said that an illegality warranting interference under article 136 is committed if some other method is adopted \\nthe tribunal has given satisfactory reason for adopting a different mode and we are not disposed to interfere with the award of the tribunal \\nin the result both the appeals are dismissed without any order as to costs \\nthe order of the court was as follows \\nin view of the opinion of the majority both the appeals are dismissed and there is no order as to costs \\n\",\n          \"ujjagar singh the appellant herein a resident of village bangawali tehsil malerkotla was tried and convicted by the additional sessions judge sangrur for the murder of his niece mukhtiar kaur and was awarded the death penalty \\nin addition he was convicted for an offence punishable section 376 of the ipc and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to a fine of rs 5 000 and in default of payment to undergo further r i for one year and section 309 of the ipc to a sentence of simple imprisonment for one year \\nthe aforesaid convictions and sentences have been maintained by the high court and the matter is before us in these proceedings by way of special leave \\nthe facts of the case are as under \\nat about 2 00 p m on 10th november 2002 a boy whose identity is not forthcoming informed satnam singh pw2 that an incident of firing had taken place in the house of ujjagar singh situated in the fields on the outskirts of the village \\nsatnam singh conveyed this information to sarpanch jora singh pw1 who was attending a marriage at that time \\njora singh accompanied by gurdeep singh pw3 thereupon rushed to ujjagar singh  s house and found mukhtiar kaur lying dead with a gun shot injury and the appellant also with a gun shot injury lying unconscious on the ground in the adjoining room \\njora singh and gurdeep singh immediately removed ujjagar singh to the civil hospital dhuri in the jeep belonging to kulwant singh pw4 \\njora singh also met inspector harjinder pal singh pw14 at 4 40 p m near the hospital who recorded his statement at that place and with his endorsement exhibit p a sent it to police station dhuri where the formal fir was registered at about 4 45 p m with the special report being delivered to the illaka magistrate at dhuri itself at 6 20 p m the same evening \\nthe facts as narrated were that arjan singh of village bangawali had three sons puran singh ujjagar singh appellant and ajmer singh \\npuran singh had died about 20 years earlier leaving behind his wife two sons and a daughter mukhtiar kaur \\nthe two sons and the wife also died long before the incident and mukhtiar kaur the sole surviving member of this branch of the family had been married to balwinder singh pw9 about 9 or 10 years earlier \\npuran singh had however transferred 30 or 35 bighas of agricultural land falling to his share after the death of his father in the name of the appellant  s sons by a collusive decree in the year 1994 and the suggestion was that this transaction had been objected to by mukhtiar kaur who was demanding that the land be returned to her \\nit appears that mukhtiar kaur  s relations with her in laws had got strained and she had left her matrimonial home and come to live with ujjagar singh her uncle 7 or 8 months earlier and the suggestion was that mukhtiar kaur had been killed by the appellant with his licensed gun and he had thereafter attempted to commit suicide \\nhaving recorded the aforesaid facts in the fir pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh reached the place of incident and lifted one spent 12 bore cartridge case shaktiman make from near mukhtiar kaur  s dead body and one dbbl gun from the place where ujjagar singh appeared to have been shot and another spent cartridge case was recovered from the right barrel of the gun \\nafter completion of the investigation at the spot mukhtiar kaur  s dead body was sent for its post mortem examination \\nthe post mortem examination was also conducted by pw5 dr ishwar singh medical officer civil hospital along with dr harwinder kaur pw17 and it was found that mukhtiar kaur had two gunshot injuries on her dead body a wound of entry on the back of right side of chest 2 cm x 1 cm with margining and blackening and a corresponding exit wound of 5 cm x 3 5 cm to the front of the right side of the chest \\ndr harwinder kaur aforesaid also took swabs from the vagina of the deceased and as per the chemical examiner  s report dated 2 1 2003 semen was found on the swab taken from the vagina and from the underwear that mukhtiar kaur had been wearing at the time of her death \\nthe weapon and the recovered cartridge cases had also been sent to the forensic science laboratory which in its report dated 4 8 2004 opined that the crime cartridge case ci could have been fired by the right barrel of the weapon whereas the crime cartridge case c2 had been fired from the right barrel \\non the completion of the investigation a charge sheet under sections 302 376 and 309 of the ipc was filed against the accused and as he pleaded not guilty he was brought to trial \\nduring the trial jora singh pw1 satnam singh pw2 gurdeep singh pw3 and kulwant singh pw4 resiled from their statements given to the police and were declared hostile \\nbalwinder singh pw9 however supported the prosecution case deposing that the land had in fact been got transferred from gurmail kaur mother of mukhtiar kaur to ujjagar singh by fraud and mukhtiar kaur was therefore entitled to its return \\nhe also deposed that mukhtiar kaur had told him some time earlier that the accused had been beating her and had also committed sexual intercourse with her and that at about 11 p m on 10 11 2002 karam singh pw10 had informed him as to what had transpired on which he along with his father hamir singh pw12 and several others had rushed to bangawali \\npw10 karam singh aforesaid confirmed the story given by balwinder singh \\nthe prosecution also relied on the statements of dr vijay kumar pw6 of the civil hospial dhuri who testified that the appellant had been brought to the hospital at about 2 45 p m on 10 11 2002 with a serious gun shot injury dr ripan miglani pw15 of the dayanand medical college hospital ludhiana who deposed that he had been admitted to the department of neuro surgery with a serious gun shot injury and dr sanjay uppal pw16 a plastic surgeon who disclosed that the appellant had been under his treatment for almost 5 weeks and the burnt area around the firearm injury had been removed by him \\nthe prosecution also placed reliance on the statement of asi jasbir singh pw11 who had accompanied inspector harjinder pal singh pw14 to the place of incident and supported the recoveries made from the spot \\nthe prosecution case was then put to the accused and his statement recorded section \\n313 of the cr \\np c in reply to question 33 he stated as under i am innocent \\ni have been implicated falsely in this case \\ni was treating mukhtiar kaur as my daughter and loved her as my daughter \\nfalse allegations have been levelled against me \\ni never harassed mukhtiar kaur nor ever got her land mutated from her mother by fraud \\ni have not killed mukhtiar kaur \\nmother of mukhtiar kaur got the land mutated by her own free will and mukhtiar kaur had no dispute about it \\nbalwinder singh her husband was addicted to vices and used to beat her due to which she used to remain under depression and sick generally and used to come to me as my daughter \\nmy house kothi is situated on the outer skirts of village bangawali and door planks had not been fixed so far to rooms \\nsome body suddenly came and fired at me \\ni fell down on the ground and became unconscious \\ntherefore i could not see what had happened to mukhtiar kaur as she was in other room \\nlater on i came to know that some body had fired at her and she died \\ni regained consciousness in hospital \\nthe story of rape by me with her has been fabricated by her husband as he is inimical towards me \\neven i do not know who took me to hospital \\ni have been implicated in this case falsely \\nthe trial court and the high court relying on the circumstances available on the evidence convicted and sentenced the appellant as already mentioned above \\nmr goburdhan the learned counsel for the accused has raised several arguments in the course of hearing \\nhe has pointed out that there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that mukhtiar kaur had been subjected to rape and in this view of the matter the very basis for the imposition of the death penalty was not made out \\nhe has also pointed out that there were no eye witnesses to the incident and the 4 witnesses i e jora singh and others who had reached the place of incident and carried the injured appellant to the hospital had also resiled and as the prosecution story now rested on circumstantial evidence alone it was imperative for the investigating officer to have taken the finger prints from the weapon and that in any case the recovery of the spent cartridges and the gun were clearly suspicious as the weapon had been sent to the laboratory after an inordinate delay \\nit has also been submitted that in a case of attempted suicide a firearm must of necessity be used from a very close range and the absence of any blackening charring or burning around the wound on ujjagar singh clearly ruled out the possibility of such an attempt \\nit has finally been submitted that the land had been transferred in the name of ujjagar singh  s sons in the year 1994 by gurmail kaur mother of mukhtiar kaur by a collusive decree and there was no evidence to show that mukhtiar kaur had ever displayed any unhappiness or made any complaint to any person or any authority with regard to the decree and as such the very basis of the prosecution story did not exist \\nthe learned state counsel has however supported the judgment of the courts below \\nhe has further emphasized that the prosecution  s case stood proved from various factors including the medical evidence the reports of the forensic science laboratory the chemical examiner from the post mortem reports and the recovery of the gun and cartridges \\nwe have heard the learned counsel for the parties and gone through the record \\nwe first take up for consideration the question of the conviction section 376 of the ipc \\nwe find from the medical evidence and from the chemical examiner  s reports that the vaginal swab and clothes taken from the dead body did indicate the presence of semen \\nthere is however absolutely no evidence to suggest even assuming that the intercourse had been committed by the appellant that he had done so without mukhtiar kaur  s consent or against her will \\nsome suspicions of rape could perhaps have been raised had some tell tale injuries been detected on mukhtiar kaur  s person but we find that the two injuries other than the gun shot wounds i e injury no 3 being on the left pinna and \\nno 4 an abrasion near the right eye do not indicate any attempt to rape or the commission of rape \\nit is also significant that the investigators had made no attempt whatsoever to have the appellant medically examined to ascertain his capacity to perform sexual intercourse \\nthe learned state counsel relying on the statement of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh has however submitted that the examination had not been possible as the appellant had received a very serious gun shot injury and was hanging between life and death \\nwe agree with the submission of the learned counsel that an examination could not have been carried out immediately \\nbut we see no justification in the omission of the prosecution to have him examined after he had recovered his health and been discharged from hospital \\nwe are further of the opinion that even assuming for a moment that sexual intercourse between the two had indeed taken place it can not be said from the evidence before us that it was without the consent or against the wishes of mukhtiar kaur \\nwe therefore find that ujjagar singh  s conviction section 376 of the ipc can not be sustained \\nmr goburdhan has placed great emphasis on the fact that as the four witnesses who had reached the place of incident i e jora singh satnam singh gurdeep singh and kulwant singh had resiled from their statements and had disowned their initial stories the prosecution had of necessity to rely on circumstantial evidence and if the chain of circumstances remained incomplete or even if one link in the chain was broken the prosecution must fail \\nhe has also relied on the judgment of balu sonba shinde v state of maharashtra 2002 7 scc 543 2002 indlaw sc 1923 to contend that it was open to the accused to take advantage insofar as possible from the statement of a witness though declared hostile and the four witnesses having disowned the prosecution story and having given a different version the appellant was entitled to derive such benefit as possible in this situation \\nthe learned state counsel has however emphasized that both the trial court and the high court had for good reasons opined that the circumstances made out a case for conviction and the accused having given a counter version some obligation lay on him as well to explain the circumstances against him inasmuch that admittedly he and the victim were alone in the house at the time of the incident \\nreliance for this argument has been placed on the decision of raj kumar prasad tamarkar v state of bihar anr 20071 \\nscale 19 2007 indlaw sc 5 \\nwe have considered their arguments very carefully \\nin mahmood v state of u p 1976 1 scc 542 1975 indlaw sc 643 it has been observed that in a case dependent wholly on circumstantial evidence the court must be satisfied athat the circumstances from which the inference of guilt is to be drawn have been fully established by unimpeachable evidence beyond a shadow of doubt bthat the circumstances are of a determinative tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused and cthat the circumstances taken collectively are incapable of explanation on any reasonable hypothesis save that of the guilt sought to be proved against him \\nin this case this court held that the omission of the prosecution inter alia to have the finger prints found on the alleged murder weapon was fatal to the prosecution story \\nin 1984 4 scc 116 sharad birdhichand sarda v state of maharashtra 1984 indlaw sc 432 this court discussed the ratio of the judgments in hanumant v state of m p air 1952 sc 343

maharashtra 1973 2 scc 793 1973 indlaw sc 181 and observed thus a close analysis of this decision would show that the following conditions must be fulfilled before a case against an accused can be said to be fully established 1the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established \\nit may be noted here that this court indicated that the circumstances concerned must or should and not may be established \\nthere is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between may be proved and must be or should be proved as was held by this court in shivaji sahabrao bobade v state of maharashtra 1973 indlaw sc 181 where the following observations were made \\ncertainly it is a primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and the mental distance between may be is long and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions \\n2the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused that is to say they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty 3the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency 4they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved and 5there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion

sc 144 in support of his plea relating to the evaluation of circumstantial evidence \\nthese judgments have broadly followed the principles laid down in the judgments referred to above and need not therefore be dealt with us in extenso \\nit must nonetheless be emphasized that whether a chain is complete or not would depend on the facts of each case emanating from the evidence and no universal yardstick should ever be attempted \\nit is in this background that we must examine the circumstances in the present case \\na few facts stand out from the prosecution story \\nfirst the place of incident being adjoining rooms in the residential house of the appellant and the fact that the alleged murder weapon is his licensed dbbl gun is proved on record \\nthe evidence also reveals that the appellant was living in the premises along with his wife mother and son and two daughters who were studying outside the village were frequent visitors but it is the admitted position that nobody but the appellant and the deceased were present at the time of incident \\nit is also clear from the evidence that the two spent cartridge cases recovered one from near mukhtiar kaur  s dead body and the second from the right barrel of the gun lying near the appellant had been sent to the forensic science laboratory which opined that one of the cartridges had been fired from the gun and the other could have been fired therefrom \\nmr goburdhan has however laid great emphasis on the fact that no reference to the gun or cartridges had been made in the inquest report and that in any case the weapon and the spent cartridges had been sent to the laboratory belatedly \\nwe are of the opinion however that no adverse inference can be drawn from either of these circumstances \\nthe aforesaid articles had been carried to the laboratory by constable gopal singh who in his affidavit dated 17th march 2003 deposed that he had first taken the articles to the laboratory on 9th december 2002 but they had been returned by the director on the ground that the seals affixed thereon were not of the requisite number and that after removing the objections raised by the director the articles aforesaid had been returned to the laboratory on 18th december 2002 \\ngopal singh was cross examined by the prosecution \\nand but for some inconsequential questions put to him with regard to the seals not even a suggestion was made that the aforesaid articles had in any way been tampered with \\nit is true as contended that in column 22 of the inquest report which refers to the articles found near the dead body there is no reference to the spent cartridges or the murder weapon but we find from a perusal of the site plan exh \\npjj prepared by the investigating officer inspector harjinder pal singh pw14 on 10th november 2002 that the weapon is shown lying close to the place where the appellant had been found unconscious and a spent cartridge recovered from near the dead body of mukhtiar kaur \\nit has also been submitted by mr goburdhan that there appeared to be no motive for the incident as the story about mukhtiar kaur  s unhappiness about the transfer of land to the sons of ujjagar singh sought to be proved by pw9 balwinder singh and pw10 karam singh had been disbelieved by the high court with the observation that the statements of these two witnesses could not be relied upon \\nit is true that in a case relating to circumstantial evidence motive does assume great importance but to say that the absence of motive would dislodge the entire prosecution story is perhaps giving this one factor an importance which is not due and to use the clichi \\nthe motive is in the mind of the accused and can seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy \\nthere is however a hint in the testimony of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh that his enquiries had revealed that the accused was having illicit relations with mukhtiar kaur and we can assume that some thing untoward had happened which could have triggered the volatile and hostile incident \\nthere could perhaps be some truth in this suggestion as it is significant that though the appellant had an extended family living with him i e mother wife son living in the village and two young daughters who were studying outside and residing in a hostel but were frequent visitors home yet none of them has come forth to depose in his favour \\nto our mind therefore this is yet another circumstance inculpating the accused \\nmr goburdhan has also laid much stress on the apparent discordance between the prosecution story and the medical evidence and has argued that had the accused attempted to commit suicide the gun shot must of necessity had to be fired from a very close range on which the wound would have marks of burning or charring and that in any event a full blooded shot from a very close range would have torn his face apart \\nhe has in this connection referred us to the statement of dr ripan miglani pw15 and the wound found on the appellant at the time of his medical examination in the department of surgery of the dayanand medical college hospital ludhiana which was about 15 x 8 cm curvilinear wound present on the left half of face extending upto bone \\nno blackening or foreign body was visible \\nunderlying muscles were exposed and contamination was present \\nhe has thus urged that the absence of any blackening underlined the argument that the shot had been fired from some distance and as such an attempt at suicide was clearly to be ruled out \\nhe has also drawn our attention to the cross examination of the doctor wherein he reiterated that there was no visible blackening and that it was not possible for him to say whether the injury was suicidal or otherwise \\nthe learned state counsel has however relied on the statement of pw16 dr sanjay uppal who was apparently the first doctor to have examined the appellant wherein he clearly testified that the blackened portion around the firearm injury had been removed by him \\nwe are therefore of the opinion that this statement falsifies mr goburdhan  s argument on this aspect \\nit is also significant that the shot had apparently travelled upwards skirting the mandible through the flesh of the cheek in an upward direction with minimal damage to the bone structure and it is indeed providential that the appellant got away with only an injury albeit a very serious one \\nthe fact that the shot was fired from below going upwards is also supported by the site plan exh \\npjj wherein marks of a shot hitting the roof were seen at point e whereas the appellant was found lying at point d in the same room \\nit is therefore apparent that the weapon had indeed been fired by the appellant from a close range and that the blackened portion around the wound had been removed by dr sanjay uppal \\nthe learned state counsel has emphasized that in the light of the admitted position that the accused and the deceased were the only ones present at the time of incident and that the accused had projected a counter story some credible explanation was also expected from him \\nreference has been made to raj kumar prasad tamarkar  s case2007 indlaw sc 5 supra wherein in circumstances surprisingly akin to the present matter this court had the following observations to make the conspectus of the events which had been noticed by the learned sessions judge as also by the high court categorically go to show that at the time when the occurrence took place the deceased and the respondent only were in the bedroom and the terrace connecting the same \\nthere was no other person \\nthe cause of death of the deceased usha devi i e by a gun shot injury is not disputed \\nthe fact that the terrace and the bedroom are adjoining each other is not in dispute \\nthe autopsy report shows that a blackening and charring existed so far as injury no i is concerned \\nthe blackening and charring keeping in view the nature of the firearm which is said to have been used clearly go to show that a shot was fired from a short distance \\nblackening or charring is possible when a shot is fired from a distance of about 2 feet to 3 feet \\nit therefore can not be a case where the death might have been caused by somebody by firing a shot at the deceased from a distance of more than 6 feet \\nthe place of injury is also important \\nthe lacerated wound was found over grabella middle of forehead \\nit goes a long way to show that the same must have been done by a person who wanted to kill the deceased from a short distance \\nthere was thus a remote possibility of causation of such type of injury by any other person who was not in the terrace \\nonce the prosecution has been able to show that at the relevant time the room and terrace were in exclusive occupation of the couple the burden of proof lay upon the respondent to show under what circumstances death was caused to his wife \\nthe onus was on him \\nhe failed to discharge the same \\nwe have considered the submission of the state counsel very carefully \\nit is true that it is generally for the prosecution to prove its case beyond doubt but in circumstances such as the present one some explanation is also due from an accused in order to absolve himself from suspicion of the crime \\nin his statement section p c his positive stand was that he alone had been in the house with mukhtiar kaur when she had been killed and indeed as per exhibit p jj mukhtiar kaur  s body had been found only one karam 5 feet away from the place where the appellant lay injured \\nit must be emphasized that but for this self serving statement made by the appellant there is nothing on record to support his positive stance \\neven otherwise we are of the opinion that had the shot been fired by some intruder the direction would have been more or less horizontal and parallel to the ground and not from down upwards with the pellets hitting the jaw skirting the cheek and hitting the roof at point \\ne in modi  s medical jurisprudence and toxicology 23rd edition at page 765 while dealing with identification of homicidal and suicidal injuries it has been observed that a suicidal firearm wound is usually a contact wound situated on the side of the temple depending on which hand was used to shoot himself in the centre of the forehead the roof of the mouth in the chest or epigastrium in front or the left side and some times under the chin \\nthe firearm is usually fired at close range \\na small weapon like a revolver or a pistol is held in the hand while a rifle or a shot gun is supported on the ground or against the wall \\nsometimes the firing is done by pulling a string tied to the trigger by the big toe \\nthe skin around the entry wound shows characteristic blackening scorching and tattooing \\nin such cases the hand used to steady the weapon at the muzzle may be blackened and scorched and may also be stained with squirting of the blood from the injured arteries \\nin homicidal and accidental shooting the wound may be on any part of the body and the path of the bullet may be in any direction \\nhomicidal shooting by dacoits is not uncommon in india and they are known to make their own firearms \\nimmediate death following a firearm wound is uncommon and even when vital organs are injured a person may be capable of doing extraordinary things \\nsometimes firearm wounds may look like knife slashes or a bullet hole may resemble a penetrating stab wound if the bullet strikes the head of shoulder at an angle or when an unstable bullet registers a broadside hit \\na fateh describes a rare homicidal gun shot wound of the mouth where the entry wound was in the tongue and the direction was horizontally backward while in suicidal wounds the direction is upwards entrance would be in the palate or posterior pharynx \\ndr b r sharma in his book forensic science in criminal investigation and trials fourth edition at page 1160 too has delineated the circumstances that could indicate suicide and while referring to the site of the injury has observed certain sites are predominantly used by suicides for self inflicted injuries \\nfor example with firearm temple forehead mouth and chest are the favourite sites \\nwith knife throat and wrist are the favourite sites \\nhesitation injuries are also observed in some suicide cases \\nit is therefore clear to us that the story of unknown assailants entering the house and causing mukhtiar kaur  s murder etcetera has to be ruled out and that the prosecution story that it was the appellant who had first shot mukhtiar kaur and then attempted to commit suicide stands proved \\nwe also find that no part of the evidence of the hostile witnesses comes to the aid of the appellant \\nthe question now arises as to the sentence that should be imposed on the appellant \\nit would be seen that both the sessions court and the high court were appalled by the allegations and findings of incestuous rape and murder \\nwe are however of the opinion as already noted above that a case of rape has not been made out \\nin this background the death sentence is not called for \\nwe accordingly acquit the appellant of the charge section 376 of the ipc but maintain his conviction for the other offences but commute his death sentence to life \\nwith this modification the appeal is dismissed \\nappeal dismissed \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"expected_output\",\n

centrifugal pumps also under the mark  field marshall  allegedly on the premise that the first respondent is the proprietor of the said mark by reason of long user and thus acquired a reputation in that behalf a legal notice was issued upon it questioning its right to use the said mark in respect of centrifugal pumps by the appellant laying a claim that it had been using the said mark since 1963  respondent no 1 thereafter filed a suit in the delhi high court for grant of a decree of permanent injunction being suit no 2408 of 1985 alleging infringement of the said mark and or claiming right of passing off in respect thereof  an ex parte order of injunction was passed on 19 12 1985 against the defendant  meanwhile a temporary ex parte injunction is issued against the defendants restraining them from manufacturing or selling either themselves or through any dealer or representative diesel oil engines or parts thereof with the trade mark  field marshal  and or any other trade mark identical therewith and all goods falling in cl 7 of the trade and merchandise mark rules  the second rectification application filed by the first respondent however was transferred to the intellectual property appellate board  the said application was dismissed  a writ petition was filed there against by the first respondent  a learned single judge of the delhi high court however refused to stay the operation of the order of the board dated 27 10 2004 an appeal was preferred there against  the division bench of the high court thereafter while disposing of both the writ petition and the letters patent appeal allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of the board and directed it to adjudicate the dispute on merits  the said order of the division bench is under challenge in this appeal   argument appellant s counsel appeared on that date and inter alia contended that presently it was the registered owner of the trade mark which was sought to be cancelled  in view of that statement a submission was made on behalf of the first respondent that it may be permitted to withdraw the petition with liberty to file a fresh petition on the same cause of action   issue whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case the application under s 46 1  b  was maintainable  whether  to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps  goods  so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned   analysis the core question which arises for our consideration is as to whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case the application under s 46 1  b  was maintainable  indisputably the scope of the provisions for removal from register in terms of s 46 and 56 of the act stand on different footings  whereas s 46 had a limited application s 56 of the act is wider in nature  concededly cl  a  of sub s  1  of s 46 is not attracted in the case  the prayer in the application was to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps  goods  so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned  it is in the aforementioned situation it is advisable to determine the meaning of the words  for the time being  occurring in s 46 1  b  of the act  two interpretations thereto which are possible are   1  the said words would denote non use of the trade mark in relation to the goods by the appellant for a period of five years or longer  and  2  the mark had not been used for a period of five years or longer either by the present proprietor thereof or his predecessor  the words  for the time being  would mean differently in different situations  it may mean  the moment or existing position  as was held by this court in the case of jivendra nath kaul v  collector district magistrate and anr   1992  3 scc 576 1992 indlaw sc 1107  or in the context of cl  22  of art 366 of the constitution as has been

with authority to recognize or not to recognize a ruler arbitrarily   the expression  for them time being  predicts that there shall be a ruler of the indian state that if the first recognized ruler dies or ceases to be a ruler a successor shall be appointed and that there shall not be more rulers than one at a given time  the person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods as that of the registered owner  it confers an exclusive right of use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in which the trade mark is registered  whether s 46 1  b  read with s 48 of the act would bring within its purview not only a registered proprietor but also the proprietor who had otherwise acquired a right would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case  the court while construing a statute takes into consideration the parliamentary intent in amending the provisions thereof  it seeks to enhance the period of moratorium of use of the registered trade mark from one month to three months so as to prevent speculative assignment  thus a case of speculative assignment is specifically required to be made out  such an application may be maintainable in terms of s 56 of the act but strictly not in terms of s 46 1  b  thereof and that too in the absence of the original registered proprietor  attention has again been drawn to a passage from  law of trade marks    geographical indications  by shri k c kailasam wherein the judgment of the tribunal has been criticized in the following terms    from the above legislative intent it would seem that the period of non use of the trade mark is to be reckoned continuously from the date of its registration  in the case of american home products corporation v  mac laboratories pvt ltd  rendered under the 1958 act it was held by the supreme court that  the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the register has only to prove  such continuous non user   it would appear that neither the u k act nor the indian act at any time envisaged that the commencement of 5 year period of non use is to be delinked from the date of registration of the mark so as to give a fresh lease of life to the registration every time there is change in the ownership of the mark  if that be so any registered proprietor could easily defeat an application for rectification by assigning the mark to some other person to have a fresh period of 5 years from the date of assignment and thus effectively frustrate the very object of the provision in s 47 1  a  and  b   further it is to be noted that an assignment is subject to  the provisions of the act and any rights vested in any other person   see  s 37  the assignor cannot obviously transfer more rights than he himself has to the assignee under the act  an assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses   statute interpretation of the provisions of s 46 1  b   and section 48 of the trade and merchandise marks act 1958  \",\n          \"facts tata consultant engineers was a partnership firm but subsequently the partnership was dissolved and in 1974 the undertaking became one of the divisions of tata sons limited  it functions as a consulting organisation and a service industry and does not manufacture any product or carry on trade its work force consists of engineers and supervisors and different categories of workmen  the tata consultant employees union served a charter of demands in july 1974 on the appellant and as their demands were not accepted and conciliation proceedings proved fruitless the state government made a reference of the dispute under s 10 1  d  industrial tribunal maharashtra for adjudication  the union filed a statement before the tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments  it was urged that the efficiency bar as a feature of the wage scales should be removed  the dearness allowance it was claimed should be granted on a slab system  the claim of the union was resisted by the appellant who maintained that the existing wage scales were fair and reasonable on a region cum industry basis and that it would not be possible for the appellant to bear the additional financial burden if the demands of the union were accepted  the appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised  there was no separate dearness allowance until january 1977 when it was introduced for the first time  house rent allowance was also paid  dearness allowance became payable at 10  of the basic wage subject to a minimum of rs 50  and house rent allowance at 30  of the basic salary  the tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years there was definite need for revising the wage scales  it also laid down the principle enabling the actual fitment of the workmen in their respective wage scales as on that date and also provided for the number of increments to which they would be entitled having regard to the period of completed service  two days after the award was made an application was made by the union stating   in the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22 in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance   the workmen have filed an appeal by special leave  in which they have challenged the rejection by the tribunal of their claim in respect of dearness allowance which they contend should be pegged to the cost of living index and should not be a fixed amount   argument considering the appeal of tata consulting engineers first the contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal erred in making the wage scales retrospective and in any event in ranging the retrospectivity back to 1st january 1976  the learned counsel for the appellant had covered a wide field but in the end he states that the appellant is aggrieved by two matters only  one is the retrospectivity attached to the revised wage scales and the other is the flat increase given to each employee of rs 150  in the category of draughtsmen and rs 100  in other categories resulting from the order dated 22nd december 1978  it is urged that the amendment results in the inclusion of a flat increase of rs 150  to each workman in the case of draughtsman and rs 100  to each workman in the case of other categories a result wholly unwarranted it is said by the intent of the original award and therefore falling beyond the jurisdiction of the tribunal  the only contention of the workmen is that the tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index   issue the primary and basic question considered by the industrial tribunal in making the award dated december 20 1978 was the question of revision of the wage scales  implicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage scales and flat or ad hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary   analysis it must be remembered that although the wage scales were introduced as long ago as 1973 they were maintained at that level except for a slight revision some time thereafter  no dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time  the cost of living had gone on increasing from 1972 onwards and as the tribunal has found the dearness allowance and house rent allowance made no appreciable impact in neutralising the increasing cost  during all these years the appellant had continued to enjoy increasing profits  nonetheless the emoluments received by the workmen did not receive the impress of the appellant s growing prosperity  the charter of demands was presented by the union in july 1974 and when conciliation proceedings failed the state government made the reference to the industrial tribunal in 1975  they are considerations which cannot be ignored  accordingly the contention raised on behalf of the appellant against retrospectivity of the wage scales must be rejected  the financial capacity of the appellant and the related study of its annual profits from 1968 to 1977 were examined from that view point  the sufficiency of the existing pay scales was considered in detail and regard was had to their original structure and the accretions made subsequently by way of dearness allowance and house rent allowance  for the purpose of restructuring the pay scales the tribunal ruled on the paying capacity of the appellant both with reference to the profits of the preceding year as well as the prospects of the future  the financial capacity as the tribunal observed constituted one of  the principles which are required to be followed in the fixation of the wage structure   no ad hoc increase to the pay of each individual workman was intended  the jurisdiction given to the tribunal by rule 31 is closely circumscribed  it is only a clerical mistake or error which can be corrected and the clerical mistake or error must arise from an accidental slip or omission in the award  an accidental slip or omission implies that something was intended and contrary to that intention what should not have been included has been included or what should have been included has been omitted  it must be a mistake or error amenable to clerical correction only  it must not be a mistake or error which calls for rectification by modification of the conscious adjudication on the issues involved  the omission of the words to each employee first after the figure rs 150  and again after the figure rs 100  was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the tribunal was entitled to correct  it will be noted that the pay scales of different categories were being restructured and the flat increase envisaged there related to an increase in the general pay scales of different categories  individual workmen were not present to the mind of the tribunal  that the increase was pertinent to the general pay scales in the revised wage structure is patently clear from a comparison of the existing pay scales and the revised pay scales  the comparative table of existing pay scales and the revised pay scales has been reproduced earlier  the revised pay scales of all categories except the category of draughtsmen shows an increase of rs 100  in the initial pay fixed in each scale the increase in the case of the category of draughtsmen being rs 150   the amendment made by the tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase this time to each individual workmen  if as the tribunal has stated in the amendment order the increase in paragraph 23 was intended to apply to each individual workmen there is nothing in the body of the award to form the foundation on which the actual figures in the restructured pay scales can be made to rest  there will be no explanation why the initial start of the revised pay scales has been increased by rs 150  in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100  in the case of other categories  considering the fitment of the workman in the revised scales it was stated in the award that a workman found drawing a salary less than the beginning of the grade would be stepped up to the beginning of the grade and if his pay fell between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay was to be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale  reliance was placed on the hindustan times ltd  new delhi v their workmen  1964  1 scr 234 1962 indlaw sc 436 247 where it was observed by this court that dearness allowance should not remain fixed at any figure but should be on a sliding scale in order to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living  now it is not a universal rule that the dearness allowance should in all cases be correlated with the cost of living index  it was open to the tribunal to adopt the position which it did  if the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered  the award is a composite document in which the several elements of increased wage scales larger increments longer span of 20 years for earning increments dearness allowance at 10  of the basic wage besides several other benefits have been integrated into a balanced arrangement in keeping with what the tribunal has found to be the financial capacity of the appellant  it is not possible to maintain one part of the award and supersede another  conspicuous by its absence is any reference to a flat increase in the pay of an individual workmen  we are not impressed with the submission that the corrigendum was in effect a fresh award  we therefore see no ground for quashing the of the tribunal  dearness allowance linked to cost of living index is ordinarily the best and the most scientific method of computing dearness allowance it cannot always be said that an illegality warranting interference under article 136 is committed if some other method is adopted  the tribunal has given satisfactory reason for adopting a different mode and we are not disposed to interfere with the award of the tribunal   statute in making the application of 22nd december 1978 the union invoked the jurisdiction of the tribunal under rule 31 of the industrial disputes  bombay  rules 1957  rule 31 provides  the labour court tribunal or arbitrator may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any award it or he issues  the application before the

ujjagar singh  the appellant herein  was tried and convicted by the additional sessions judge  sangrur for the murder of his niece mukhtiar kaur and was awarded the death penalty  in addition  he was convicted for an offence punishable u s  376 of the ipc and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to a fine of rs 5  000   and in default of payment to undergo further r i  for one year and u s  309 of the ipc to a sentence of simple imprisonment for one year  the aforesaid convictions and sentences have been maintained by the high court and the matter is before us in these proceedings by way of special leave  at about 2 00 p m  on 10th november 2002 a boy whose identity is not forthcoming  informed satnam singh pw2 that an incident of firing had taken place in the house of ujjagar singh   satnam singh conveyed this information to sarpanch jora singh pw1 who was attending a marriage at that time  jora singh accompanied by gurdeep singh pw3 thereupon rushed to ujjagar singh s house and found mukhtiar kaur lying dead with a gun shot injury and the appellant also with a gun shot injury lying unconscious on the ground in the adjoining room  it appears that mukhtiar kaur s relations with her in laws had got strained and she had left her matrimonial home and come to live with ujjagar singh  her uncle  7 or 8 months earlier and the suggestion was that mukhtiar kaur had been killed by the appellant with his licensed gun and he had thereafter attempted to commit suicide   argument the learned counsel for the accused has raised several arguments in the course of hearing  he has pointed out that there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that mukhtiar kaur had been subjected to rape and in this view of the matter the very basis for the imposition of the death penalty was not made out  he has also pointed out that there were no eye witnesses to the incident and the 4 witnesses i e  jora singh and others who had reached the place of incident and carried the injured appellant to the hospital had also resiled and as the prosecution story now rested on circumstantial evidence alone  it was imperative for the investigating officer to have taken the finger prints from the weapon and that in any case the recovery of the spent cartridges and the gun were clearly suspicious as the weapon had been sent to the laboratory after an inordinate delay  it has also been submitted that in a case of attempted suicide a firearm must of necessity be used from a very close range and the absence of any blackening  charring or burning around the wound on ujjagar singh clearly ruled out the possibility of such an attempt  it has finally been submitted that the land had been transferred in the name of ujjagar singh s sons in the year 1994 by gurmail kaur  mother of mukhtiar kaur by a collusive decree and there was no evidence to show that mukhtiar kaur had ever displayed any unhappiness or made any complaint to any person or any authority with regard to the decree and as such  the very basis of the prosecution story did not exist  he had laid great emphasis on the fact that no reference to the gun or cartridges had been made in the inquest report and that in any case the weapon and the spent cartridges had been sent to the laboratory belatedly   issue convictions and sentences by the high court should be maintained or not   analysis from the medical evidence and from the chemical examiner s reports that the vaginal swab and clothes taken from the dead body did indicate the presence of semen  there is however absolutely no evidence to suggest  even assuming that the intercourse had been committed by the appellant  that he had done so without mukhtiar kaur s consent or against her will  it is also significant that the investigators had made no attempt whatsoever to have the appellant medically examined to ascertain his capacity to perform sexual intercourse  it must nonetheless be emphasized that whether a chain is complete or not would depend on the facts of each case emanating from the evidence and no universal yardstick should ever be attempted  it is in this background that we must examine the circumstances in the present case  a few facts stand out from the prosecution story  first  the place of incident being adjoining rooms in the residential house of the appellant and the fact that the alleged murder weapon is his licensed dbbl gun is proved on record  the evidence also reveals that the appellant was living in the premises along with his wife  mother and son  and two daughters  who were studying outside the village  were frequent visitors  but it is the admitted position that nobody but the appellant and the deceased were present at the time of incident  it is also clear from the evidence that the two spent cartridge cases recovered  one from near mukhtiar kaur s dead body  and the second from the right barrel of the gun lying near the appellant had been sent to the forensic science laboratory which opined that one of the cartridges had been fired from the gun and the other could have been fired therefrom  it is true that in a case relating to circumstantial evidence motive does assume great importance but to say that the absence of motive would dislodge the entire prosecution story is perhaps giving this one factor an importance which is not due and  to use the clichi  the motive is in the mind of the accused and can seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy  there is however a hint in the testimony of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh that his enquiries had revealed that the accused was having illicit relations with mukhtiar kaur and we can assume that some thing untoward had happened which could have triggered the volatile and hostile incident  there could perhaps be some truth in this suggestion  as it is significant that though the appellant had an extended family living with him i e  mother  wife  son living  in the village  and two young daughters who were studying outside and residing in a hostel  but were frequent visitors home  yet none of them has come forth to depose in his favour  therefore  this is yet another circumstance inculpating the accused  it is also significant that the shot had apparently travelled upwards skirting the mandible  through the flesh of the cheek in an upward direction with minimal damage to the bone structure and it is indeed providential that the appellant got away with only an injury  albeit a very serious one  the fact that the shot was fired from below going upwards is also supported by the site plan exh  pjj wherein marks of a shot hitting the roof were seen at point e whereas the appellant was found lying at point d in the same room  it is therefore apparent that the weapon had indeed been fired by the appellant from a close range and that the blackened portion around the wound had been removed by dr  sanjay uppal  it is true that it is generally for the prosecution to prove its case beyond doubt but in circumstances such as the present one  some explanation is also due from an accused in order to absolve himself from suspicion of the crime  no part of the evidence of the hostile witnesses comes to the aid of the appellant  the question now arises as to the sentence that should be imposed on the appellant  it would be seen that both the sessions court and the high court were appalled by the allegations and findings of incestuous rape and murder  we are however of the opinion  as already noted above  that a case of rape has not been made out  in this background the death sentence is not called for   statute section 376  309 of ipc  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

to for the sake of brevity as the said act is involved herein \\nthe factual matrix of the matter which is not much in dispute is as under \\nfirst respondent is the registered proprietor of a trade mark field marshal for diesel engines since 1964 bearing no 228867 one m s jain industries got the trade mark field marshal registered under clause 7inter alia for flour mills centrifugal pumps couplings for machines pulleys included in class 7 and valves parts of machines the said registration was renewed for the periods 13 5 1972 and 12 5 1979 13 5 1979 and 12 7 1986 and 13 7 1986 and 12 7 1993 appellant is said to have commenced its business of manufacturing and selling centrifugal pumps also under the mark field marshall \\nallegedly on the premise that the first respondent is the proprietor of the said mark by reason of long user and thus acquired a reputation in that behalf a legal notice was issued upon it questioning its right to use the said mark in respect of centrifugal pumps by the appellant laying a claim that it had been using the said mark since 1963 \\nrespondent no 1 thereafter filed a suit in the delhi high court for grant of a decree of permanent injunction

party of the second part has satisfied the party of the first part of having used the mark field marshal in respect of centrifugal pumps and valves since 1973 \\nindisputably first respondent filed an application under section 4656 and 107 of the act marked as c o no 9 of 1986contending that m s jain industries having not used the trade mark in respect of centrifugal pumps for a period more than five years and one month the mark should be taken off the register \\nit claimed user of the said mark since 1963 and sought for rectification of the register by expunging the expression circulation

works \\nin these circumstances the request of the plaintiff is granted and petitioner is permitted to withdraw this petition and file a fresh petition on this very cause of action \\nthe petition is accordingly filed as withdrawn leaving the parties to bear their own costs \\na fresh application was filed by the first respondent \\nthe said m s jain industries however was not impleaded as a party therein \\nthe cause of action therefor was stated to have arisen in the following circumstances that the cause of action for the present petition arose in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents in the month of january 1987 when the respondent informed this honourable court that they have been recorded as subsequent proprietors of the impugned registered trade mark no 228867 in class 7 in c o no 9 of 1986whereupon the petitioner withdrew the said earlier petition c o no 9 of 1986 with permission of the court to file the present petition because of the changed circumstances \\nthe cause of action is continuous from day to day till the impugned registration is cancelled rectified \\nthe injunction matter in suit no 2408 of 1985 came up for hearing before a learned single judge of the high court \\nby an order dated 19 1 1988having regard to the provisions contained in the said act the learned judge opined that appellant having become the registered proprietor of the said trade mark no case for grant of injunction has been made out the interim order of injunction passed on 19 12 1985 was vacated and the defendants were permitted to use their registered trade mark subject to the following conditions a defendants will not use the logo style of the word field marshal of which logo and style the plaintiff is the proprietor under the copyright act \\nb defendants shall mention the name of the defendant firm thukral mechanical works sirhind on each and every centrifugal pump manufactured by them and sold in the name of field marshal \\nc the defendants shall maintain proper accounts of the sale of centrifugal pumps under the trade mark field marshal and shall file them in court as and when directed \\ncorrectness or otherwise of the said order has not been questioned \\nthe second rectification application filed by the first respondent however was transferred to the intellectual property appellate board \\nthe said application was dismissed \\na writ petition was filed there against by the first respondent \\na learned single judge of the delhi high court however refused to stay the operation of the order of the board dated 27 10 2004 an appeal was preferred there against \\nthe division bench of the high court thereafter while disposing of both the writ petition and the letters patent appeal allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of the board and directed it to adjudicate the dispute on merits \\nthe said order of the division bench is under challenge in this appeal \\nthe core question which arises for our consideration is as to whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case the application under s 461b was maintainable \\nbefore adverting thereto we may take notice of the relevant statutory provisions ss 461b481482 and 56 read as under section 46 removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non use  1 subject to the provisions of section 47a registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application made in the prescribed manner to a high court or to the registrar by any person aggrieved on the ground either a b that up to a date one month before the date of the application a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being provided that except where the applicant has been permitted under sub s 3 of s 12 to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of the goods in question or where the tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark the tribunal may refuse an application u cl a or cl b in relation to any goods if it is shown that there has been before the relevent date or during the relevant period as the case may be bona fide use of the trade mark by any proprietor thereof for the time being in relation to goods of the same description being goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered \\nsection 48 registered users  1 subject to the provisions of section 49a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as the registered user thereof in respect of any or all of the goods in respect of which the trademark is registered otherwise than as a defensive trade mark but the central government may by rules made in this behalf provide that no application for registration as such shall be enertained unless the agreement between the parties complies with the conditions laid down in the rules for preventing trafficking in trade marks \\nthe permitted use of a trade mark shall be deemed to be used by the proprietor thereof and shall be deemed not to be used by a person other than the proprietor for the purposes of s 46 or for any other purpose for which such use is material under this act or any other law \\nsection 56 power to cancel or vary registration and to rectify the register  1 \\non application made in the prescribed manner to a high court or to the registrar by any person aggrieved the tribunal may make such order as it may think fit for cancelling or varying the registration of a trade mark on the ground of any contravention or failure to observe a condition entered on the register in relation thereto \\nany person aggrieved by the absence or omission from the register of any entry or by any entry made in the register without sufficient cause or by any entry wrongly remaining on the register or by any error of defect in any entry in the register may apply in the prescribed manner to a high court or to the registrar and the tribunal may make such order for making expunging or varying the entry as it may think fit \\nthe tribunal may in any proceeding under this section decide any question that may be necessary or expedient to decide in connection with the rectification of the register \\nthe tribunal of its own motion may after giving notice in the prescribed manner to the parties concerned and after giving them an opportunity of being heard make any order referred to in sub s 1 or sub s 2 \\nany order of the high court rectifying the register shall direct that notice of the rectification shall be served upon the registrar in the prescribed manner who shall upon receipt of such notice rectify the register accordingly \\nthe power to rectify the register conferred by this section shall include the power to remove a trade mark registered in part a of the register to part b of the register \\nindisputably the scope of the provisions for removal from register in terms of s 46 and 56 of the act stand on different footings \\nwhereas s 46 had a limited application s 56 of the act is wider in nature \\nconcededly cl a of sub s 1 of s 46 is not attracted in the case \\nfor the purpose of appreciation of the rival contentions we may notice the findings of the board as also the high court \\nthe board has taken the view that the period of five years and one month will begin to run from the date on which thukral became the proprietor of the trademark that is30th may1986 and therefore the rectification application could have been filed by the appellant only sometime in 1991 opining that an application for rectification against the appellant within a period of seven and a half months from the date of assignment of the trade mark was not maintainable the application was dismissed \\nthe high court on the other hand opined it was not anybody  s case before us that m s jain industries \\nthe registered proprietor of the trademark used it at all \\nthe trademark was used by the appellant and thukral neither of whom were proprietors thereof except that thukral claims to have become its proprietor with effect from 30th may1986 according to learned counsel for the appellant the use of the trademark by thukral was not legally permissible use inasmuch as thukral did not have the consent tacit or otherwise of m s jain industries to use the trademark \\nif thukral did then it can not be said that there was no bona fide use thereof by its proprietor \\nthat is m s jain industries \\nthis appears to be the position at least till 30th may1986 in \\nthe meantime as a result of the ex parte ad interim injunction granted on 19th december 1985 by this court in suit no 2408 of 1985there was no question of thukral using the trademark field marshal till the injunction was vacated on 19th january1988 \\nthe act was enacted to provide for the registration and better protection of trademarks and for the prevention of the use of fraudulent marks of merchandise \\nregistration of a trade mark remains valid for seven years \\nrenewal applications are required to be filed on the expiry of seven years \\nm s jain industries got itself registered and obtained periodical renewal thereof as

words for the time being occurring in s 461b of the act \\ntwo interpretations thereto which are possible are 1 the said words would denote non use of the trade mark in relation to the goods by the

notice that another construction of the said provision has been put forth by mr sunderam learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that the word proprietor would not mean a registered proprietor but also a person who has become proprietor by long use thereof \\nthe words for the time being would mean differently in different situations \\nit may mean the moment or

dispute that the registration of a trade mark confers a very valuable right \\nthe person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods

right of a registered proprietor \\nit therefore can be taken away only when the conditions laid down therefor are satisfied \\nwhile we say so we are not oblivious of the fact that trafficking in

a proprietor thereof by user is supposed to keep itself abreast with such applications filed by another either for registration of the trade mark or renewal thereof \\nthe non user for a long time would disentitle a registered proprietor from renewal of the registration \\nit must not however be forgotten that s 461b provides for a special remedy \\nas a person obtains a right on and from the date of registration andor renewal thereof he can ordinarily be deprived of his right unless it is shown that the assignment thereof by his holder was not a bona fide one or had been made by way of camouflage \\nif the assignee has obtained assignment for bona fide use he may not be fastened with any liability owing to non user on the part of his predecessor \\nin other words the mistake of the predecessor should not be visited with non use of the present registered owner \\nit must however be observed that whether a use is for bona fide purpose would essentially be a question of fact \\nwhether s 461b read with s 48 of the act would bring within its purview not only a registered proprietor but also the proprietor who had otherwise acquired a right would depend upon the facts and

years \\nfor the purpose of making out such a case both the original registrants as also the assignee were required to be impleaded as parties \\nwe may at this stage notice that in law of trade marks by mr k c kailasam while commenting on s 47 of the trade marks act1999 to which our attention has been drawn by mr sudhir chandra it is stated \\nnotes on clauses \\nthis clause corresponds to s 46 of the existing act and provides for removal of a trade mark from the register on the ground of non use \\na trade mark which is not used within five years of its registration becomes liable for removal either completely or in respect of those goods or services for which the mark has not been used \\nunder s 461it is proposed to clarify that the five years period will start from the date on which the trade mark is actually entered on the register \\nthis amendment is intended to remove any ambiguity as for all other purposes the date of registration will be the date on which the application was filed vide cl 232 proviso to sub cl 1 also provides that the tribunal may refuse removal of the mark if it is shown that any proprietor had in fact made bona fide use of the trademark for goods or services of the same description or associated goods or services \\nit is also proposed to increase the period from 1 to 3 months in cl 471a and b in which use of the trade mark prior to the date of filing of the application for removal of the trade mark shall be disregarded \\nthis is intended to prevent the registered proprietor to by pass the act by such token use after he comes to know that an application for removal is about to be filed sub cl 3 protects a mark from being removed from the register on ground of non use if such non use is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade \\nthe clause is proposed to be modified to clarify that special circumstances in the trade will include restrictions imposed by any law or regulation on the use of trade mark in india \\nconsequential amendments have been made to cover services cl 47 of the bill \\nthe court while construing a statute takes into consideration the parliamentary intent in amending the provisions thereof \\nit seeks to enhance the period of moratorium of use of the registered trade mark from one month to three months so as to prevent speculative assignment \\nthus a case of speculative assignment is specifically required to be made out \\nsuch an application may be maintainable in terms of s 56 of the act but strictly not in terms of s 461b thereof and that too in the absence of the original registered proprietor \\nwe are not satisfied with the explanation offered by the first respondent that it gave up the case of non use of the registered trade mark against m s jain industries on the basis of statement made by the learned counsel for the appellant firstly because consent does not confer jurisdiction secondly because want andor lack of jurisdiction on the part of the tribunal can not be waived as if any order is passed without jurisdiction the same would be a nullity and thirdly because the cause of action even according to the first respondent in his application before the high court was different \\nthe counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant did not state that it had waived its right so far as non impleadment of m s jain industries was concerned \\nit only consented for grant of liberty in favour of the first respondent for filing of an application for the self same cause of action \\nthe question of maintainability of the second suit is absence of the registrant proprietor was not and could not have been the subject matter of consent at that stage \\nthe cause of action which permitted the first respondent to file an application for rectification against m s jain industries was non user thereof by it \\nits non user and rectification of the register could not in the aforementioned situation have been tagged with the cause of action if any against the appellant \\nthe second contention of mr that the appellant was an infringer of the trade mark is again a question of fact \\nthe right of the first respondent as a proprietor of the trade mark by reason of a long user is required to be determined vis  vis m s jain industries as also the appellant in the suit filed by it which is pending \\nthe board could not while exercising its jurisdiction under s 461bof the act proceeded on the basis of such presumption \\nit is not correct that no cause of action survived against jain industries \\nit was not lost by reason of assignment as was contended by the learned counsel \\nin the suit only the competing right of the first respondent qua the appellant can be determined and not a right against m s such a right can not be determined in a proceeding under s 461b of the act which is restricted to non user of the registered trade mark \\nboth the appellant and the respondent no 1 were the infringers of the right of m s jain industries as it was the registered proprietor of the trade mark in respect of the goods in question namely centrifugal pumps \\ntwo interpretations of the said provision s 461b are possible \\nwhile interpreting the same however certain basic principles of construction of statute must be kept in mind \\nas it takes away somebody  s right it deserves strict construction \\njurisdiction of the board being dependent on determination of the foundational facts the same was required to be established on the basis of the averments made in the application and not otherwise \\nthe right of a registered trade mark is not lost automatically on the expiry of five years and one month \\nit does not provide for a sun set law \\nit has to be adjudicated upon \\nwhether the registered proprietor of the trade mark had taken recourse to trafficking or not must be determined in an appropriate proceeding \\nthe principle of purchaser of a property has a duty to make enquiriestherefore cannot apply in a case of this nature \\nso long as the right to assign a registered trade mark remains valid once the same is validly assigned the assignee derives the same right as that of the assignor in terms of the statute \\na title to a trade mark derived on assignment as provided for under the act can not be equated with a defective title acquired in any other property as admittedly on the date of assignment the right of the registered trade mark was not extinguished \\nboth the findings of the high court which we have noticed hereinbefore are findings on question of law and in that view of the matter the contention of mr sudhir chandra that the merit of the matter is yet to be gone into by the board can not be a ground for ignoring the submissions made at the bar \\nour attention has again been drawn to a passage from law of trade marks geographical indications by shri k c kailasam wherein the judgment of the tribunal has been criticized in the following terms from the above legislative intent it would seem that the period of non use of the trade mark is to be reckoned continuously from the date of its registration \\nin the case of american home products corporation v mac laboratories pvt ltd \\nrendered under the 1958 act it was held by the supreme court that the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the register has only to prove \\nsuch continuous non user \\nit would appear that neither the u k act nor the indian act at any time envisaged that the commencement of 5 year period of non use is to be delinked from the date of registration of the mark so as to give a fresh lease of life to the registration every time there is change in the ownership of the mark \\nif that be so any registered proprietor could easily defeat an application for rectification by assigning the mark to some other person to have a fresh period of 5 years from the date of assignment and thus effectively frustrate the very object of the provision in s 471a and b further it is to be noted that an assignment is subject to the provisions of the act and any rights vested in any other person see \\ns 37 the assignor can not obviously transfer more rights than he himself has to the assignee under the act \\nwe do not think that the approach of the learned author is entirely correct \\nan assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses \\nif his title is not extinguished by reason of a provision of a statute for non user of the trade mark for a period of five years any assignment made shall be valid subject to such situation which we have noticed in paragraph 25 supra \\nfor the views we have taken we are of the opinion that the impugned judgment can not be sustained \\nit is set aside accordingly \\nthe board shall however proceed to determine afresh the application filed by the first in the light of the legal principles explained above \\nthe appeal is allowed with costs \\ncounsel  s fee assessed at rs 100000 \\nappeal allowed \\n\",\n          \"this appeal by special leave has been preferred by tata consultancy engineers against an award dated 20th december1978 of the industrial tribunal maharashtra bombay revising the wage scales of certain categories of employees and granting various other benefits \\ntata consultant engineers at its inception was a partnership firm but subsequently the partnership was dissolved and in 1974 the undertaking became one of the divisions of tata sons limited \\nit functions as a consulting organisation and a service industry and does not manufacture any product or carry on trade \\nits work force consists of engineers and supervisors and different categories of workmen \\nout of 665 employees at bombay the draftsmen and the administrative staff number 306 these workmen are members of the tata consultant employees union \\nthey served a charter of demands in july1974on the appellant and as their demands were not accepted and conciliation proceedings proved fruitless the state government made a reference of the dispute under s 101 dindustrial tribunal maharashtra for adjudication \\nthe reference was numbered i t no 292 of 1975 \\nthe union filed a statement before the tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments \\nit was urged that the efficiency bar as a feature of the wage scales should be removed \\nthe dearness allowance it was claimed should be granted on a slab system \\nthe claim of the union was resisted by the appellant who maintained that the existing wage scales were fair and reasonable on a region cum industry basis and that it would not be possible for the appellant to bear the additional financial burden if the demands of the union were accepted \\nreference was made to the political uncertainty in iran which had placed an appreciable part of the appellant  s business in jeopardy and to various other factors peculiar to an engineering consultancy business beyond the appellant  s control \\nthere was fierce competition also it was asserted from other similar organisations \\nthe appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised \\nthere was no separate dearness allowance until january1977 when it was introduced for the first time \\nhouse rent allowance was also paid \\ndearness allowance became payable at 10 of the basic wage subject to a minimum of rs 50 and house rent allowance at 30 of the basic salary \\nnothing those facts the tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years there was definite need for revising the wage scales \\nit was pointed out that the dearness allowance and house rent allowance granted by the appellant made little impact in neutralising the cost of living \\nthe need for revising the wage scales was not disputed by the appellant \\nin proceeding to revise the wage structure the tribunal took into account the two principles involved in the process the financial capacity of the industry to bear the burden of an increased wage bill and the prevailing wage structure on an industry cum region basis \\nwage scale statements were filed by the parties before the tribunal pertaining to several engineering consultancy organisations but \\nin the absence of pertinent information concerning the strength of their labour force the extent of their business the financial position for some years the capital invested the precise nature of the business the position regarding reserves dividends declared and future prospects of the company the tribunal found that it was unable to rely on them as comparable concerns \\nholding it impossible in the circumstances to apply the principle of industry cum region basis the tribunal turned to a consideration of the financial capacity of the company to bear an additional burden in this connection it proceeded on the footing that the appellant was a separate and independent division of tata sons limited and had no functional integrality with the other divisions \\nhaving regard to the net profits earned by the appellant from 1968 to 1977 it found that the acceptance of the demands of the union would result in an increased burden of rs 7 crores a burden which would dry up the appellant  s resources and would be impossible for it to bear \\nthe union modified its demands but even the modified terms according to the tribunal appeared to be on the high side inasmuch as the resulting total burden of rs 1 70 crores was much higher than the average profits could sustain \\nthe particular character of the appellant that it was a service industry and not a manufacturing concern was taken into account and it was observed that unlike a manufacturing business there was little scope for diversification in the case of an engineering consultancy \\nnonetheless the tribunal observed there was every reason to expect that the appellant would be able to earn sound profits in the future and the instability in its business activities occasioned by the turbulent political situation in iran would be it was expected compensated by contracts secured in different developing countries \\nfor the purpose of determining the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal followed unichem laboratories v their workmen 1972 indlaw sc 181 where it was held that the gross profits should be computed without making deductions on account of taxation development rebate and depreciation \\nit decided also that there was no ground for deducting the notional value of gratuity \\nrevising the figures on that basis it computed the annual gross profits for the years 1968 to 1977 and determined the annual average at rs 26 69 lakhs \\nthe tribunal took note of the elaborate scales of wages already existing in the wage structure of the appellant and decided to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category \\nit also observed that the category of draughtsmen needed a special increase \\nbut it rejected the demand of the union for dearness allowance on the basis of a slab system because that would have imposed an unacceptable burden on the appellant  s financial capacity and there was no reason why the existing scheme of dearness allowance should be disturbed when a substantial increase was being made in the level of the basic wage \\ntaking into account the circumstance that besides the staff of 306 workmen represented by the union there were several other employees who would also have to be paid the tribunal considered it fair in paragraph 23 of the award to give a flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories \\nit rejected the demand of the union for abolishing the efficiency bar but the span of 15 years for earning increment was expanded in some grades to 20 years and some adjustments were also made in specific grades \\nthe tribunal also noted that after the salaries of the employees had been fixed in the respective scales senior employees would have to be given some more increments in the new scales according to their completed years of service \\ntaking all these factors into consideration it made an award dated 20th december1978 prescribing the following revision in the existing scales of wages \\nthe tribunal maintained the existing schemes of dearness allowance and house rent allowance and observed that in view of the revised basic wages there would be a resultant increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance \\nthe revised wage scales the tribunal directed should take effect retrospectively from 1st january1976 it also laid down the principle enabling the actual fitment of the workmen in their respective wage scales as on that date and also provided for the number of increments to which they would be entitled having regard to the period of completed service \\ntwo days after the award was made an application was made by the union stating in the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance \\nfurther it appears that the tribunal intended to grant the increase of rs 150 to each draughtsman and rs 100 to all other workmen in their basic pay \\nhowever this is not clearly mentioned anywhere in the award due to accidental slip or omission \\nthe union prayed that the position may be clarified and the award corrected accordingly \\non the same date the tribunal disposed of the application by the following order there can be no doubt that a flat increase of rs 150 to each of the employees in the category of draftsmen and of rs 100 to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award \\nthe same has been made clear in paragraph \\nno 23but it appears that the words to each employee after the figure rs 150 were omitted \\nsimilarly the same words to each employee after the figure 100 were omitted \\nwhen the award is sent for publication a necessary corrigendum be made in the award and the aforesaid words after the figures rs 150 and rs 100 be added \\nit may be mentioned that only from that point of view viz to grant flat increase of rs 150 and of rs 100 to the employees in the category of draftsmen and the other categories respectively that a burden statement was called for from the company and the same was submitted vide exhibit c 51 the fitment has also to be done only after the flat increase is added to the present basic salary of each employee \\ni do not think that any problem would arise for interpretation of the award \\nsince the award has been already signed i do not think anything further can be added to this award \\nsd k n wani industrial tribunal \\nin this appeal the learned counsel for the appellant had covered a wide field but in the end he states that the appellant is aggrieved by two matters only \\none is the retrospectivity attached to the revised wage scales and the other is the flat increase given to each employee of rs 150 in the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in other categories resulting from the order dated 22nd december1978 \\nthe workmen have filed an appeal by special leave civil appeal no 2300 of 1979in which they have challenged the rejection by the tribunal of their claim in respect of dearness allowance which they contend should be pegged to the cost of living index and should not be a fixed amount \\nconsidering the appeal of tata consulting engineers first the contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal erred in making the wage scales retrospective and in any event in ranging the retrospectivity back to 1st january1976 \\nwe have been taken through some of the material on the record in the attempt to support the contention but after giving careful thought to the matter i think there is ample justification for what the tribunal did \\nit must be remembered that although the wage scales were introduced as long ago as 1973 they were maintained at that level except for a slight revision some time thereafter \\nno dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time \\nthe cost of living had gone on increasing from 1972 onwards and as the tribunal has found the dearness allowance and house rent allowance made no appreciable impact in neutralising the increasing cost \\nduring all these years the appellant had continued to enjoy increasing profits nonetheless the emoluments received by the workmen did not receive the impress of the appellant  s growing prosperity \\nthe charter of demands was presented by the union in july1974 and when conciliation proceedings failed the state government made the reference to the industrial tribunal in 1975 the tribunal has referred to various considerations which prevailed with it in giving retrospectivity to the revised pay scales \\nthey are considerations which can not be ignored \\naccordingly the contention raised on behalf of the appellant against retrospectivity of the wage scales must be rejected \\nthe challenge embodied in the second contention against the amendment of the award is more serious \\nit is urged that the amendment results in the inclusion of a flat increase of rs 150 to each workman in the case of draughtsman and rs 100 to each workman in the case of other categories a result wholly unwarranted it is said by the intent of the original award and therefore falling beyond the jurisdiction of the tribunal \\nin making the application of 22nd \\ndecember1978the union invoked the jurisdiction of the \\ntribunal under rule 31 of the industrial disputes bombay rules1957 rule 31 provides the labour court tribunal or arbitrator may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any award it or he issues \\nthe jurisdiction given to the tribunal by rule 31 is closely circumscribed \\nit is only a clerical mistake or error which can be corrected and the clerical mistake or error must arise from an accidental slip or omission in the award \\nan accidental slip or omission implies that something was intended and contrary to that intention what should not have been included has been included or what should have been included has been omitted \\nit must be a mistake or error amenable to clerical correction only \\nit must not be a mistake or error which calls for rectification by modification of the conscious adjudication on the issues involved \\nis the instant case one where the amendment made by the tribunal in the original award can be said to correct a mere clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission \\nto answer the question it is necessary to examine the basis of the award and the intent which flows from that basis \\nthe terms of reference in the state government  s order required the tribunal to revise the scales of pay and dearness allowance and there was no mention of giving any ad hoc increase in the basic pay of individual workman \\nit would do well to recall that the claim of the union filed before the tribunal also centered on the need to revise the wage scales \\nthat was the main issue between the parties \\nit is to the task of revising the pay scales that the tribunal addressed itself and throughout the material part of the award it is that task which held its focussed attention \\nthe financial capacity of the appellant and the related study of its annual profits from 1968 to 1977were examined from that view point \\nthe sufficiency of the existing pay scales was considered in detail and regard was had to their original structure and the accretions made subsequently by way of dearness allowance and house rent allowance \\nfor the purpose of restructuring the pay scales the tribunal ruled on the paying capacity of the appellant both with reference to the profits of the preceding year as well as the prospects of the future \\nthe financial capacity as the tribunal observed constituted one of the principles which are required to be followed in the fixation of the wage structure \\na clear statement of its intention is found in paragraph 22 of the award where the tribunal stated i only propose to modify the existing structures of the scales with flat increases in each category \\nno ad hoc increase to the pay of each individual workman was intended \\nand that is confirmed by what was stated in paragraph 23 of the award considering this outgoing the flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draughtsman and rs 100 in the case of the other categories would be fair \\nit will be noted that the pay scales of different categories were being restructured and the flat increase envisaged there related to an increase in the general pay scales of different categories \\nindividual workmen were not present to the mind of the tribunal \\nthat the increase was pertinent to the general pay scales in the revised wage structure is patently clear from a comparison of the existing pay scales and the revised pay scales \\nthe comparative table of existing pay scales and the revised pay scales has been reproduced earlier \\nthe revised pay scales of all categories except the category of draughtsmen shows an increase of rs 100 in the initial pay fixed in each scale the increase in the case of the category of draughtsmen being rs 150  there was only one increase contemplated in the award in paragraph 23 of award and it is more than plain that the increase was the one incorporated in the revised pay scales pertaining to different categories \\nno second flat increase was envisaged at all \\nthe amendment made by the tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase this time to each individual workmen \\nif as the tribunal has stated in the amendment order the increase in paragraph 23 was intended to apply to each individual workmen there is nothing in the body of the award to form the foundation on which the actual figures in the restructured pay scales can be made to rest \\nthere will be no explanation why the initial start of the revised pay scales has been increased by rs 150 in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories \\nconsidering the fitment of the workman in the revised scales it was stated in the award that a workman found drawing a salary less than the beginning of the grade would be stepped up to the beginning of the grade and if his pay fell between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay was to be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale \\nconspicuous by its absence is any reference to a flat increase in the pay of an individual workmen \\neven when considering the range of permissible retrospectivity the tribunal stated in the award in view of the revision of the wage scales there would be consequent increase in the dearness allowance and the house rent allowance \\nand the clinching circumstances of all is that the award was made on the basis that the overall financial load according to paragraph 33 of the award would be to the tune of about rs 5 lakhs \\nit was that figure which the tribunal had in mind against the backdrop of the gross annual figures when it made the revised pay scales retrospective from 1st \\njanuary1976 this liability taken with the liability accruing on the need to increase the salaries of the other staff determined the tribunal  s deliberations in regard to the several features of the award including the grant of increments related to completed periods of service the expansion of the span from 15 years to 20 years for earning increments and other benefits \\nit can not be the case of the union that the figure of rs 5 lakhs mentioned in paragraph 33 of the award represented the result of adding a flat increase to the pay of each workman in addition to the benefits conferred by the revised pay scales and other awarded reliefs \\nin its order of 22nd \\ndecember1978the tribunal has referred to the statement exhibit c 51 filed by the appellant when called upon to indicate the increased financial burden apprehended by it \\nthe tribunal has relied on this statement as evidence showing that the appellant knew that a flat increase of rs 150 and rs 100 was intended to each of the employees in the category of draughtsmen and the other categories \\nin so construing the statement exhibit c 51the tribunal has grievously erred \\nit seems from a perusal of the document exhibit c 51that it is a statement giving trial figures of the increased financial load on different bases \\non the basis that a sum of rs 150 per month was added to the pay of each draughtsman and a sum of rs 100 was added to the pay of every other workman who belonged to the union staff the financial load would increase to rs 922032  likewise if a flat increase of rs 100 was given to individual workmen of all categories including draughtsmen the increased financial load would total rs 764256  the statement then goes on to indicate that if a flat increase of rs 75 per month were given to individual workmen of all categories the total increase would be rs 578220  again if the flat increase is rs 65 per month to the individual workmen of all categories the additional load would total rs 497772  finally on the basis that the individual draughtsman would be given an increase of rs 75 per month and the individual workmen of other categories rs 50 per month the additional load was calculated at rs 463092  it will be noted that the statement exhibit c 51was prepared on the basis of the employees strength as in december1971 a similar statement was prepared on the basis of the employees strength as in september1978 these statements can not be regarded as evidence that the appellant was cognizant of the intention of the tribunal to provide a flat increase to the pay of each workman \\nthe statement afforded an indication merely of what the additional financial load would be if a flat increase was given to the individual workman on the alternative basis set forth therein \\nnone of the alternatives was actually adopted by the tribunal because when the award was made the tribunal proceeded instead to restructure the wage scales by the addition of rs 150 in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories to the initial pay in the wage scales pertaining to those categories \\nthe addition was integrated as a feature of the wage scales it was not regarded as an addition to the pay of each individual workman \\nit seems that the tribunal was betrayed by a curious confusion in accepting the plea of the union that a flat increase to the pay of each workman was intended in the original wage and consequently it fell into the error of amending the award \\nthe evidence contained in the award throughout provides incontrovertible proof that this flat increase was never originally intended in the award \\nthe amendment has resulted in the tribunal making as it were a supplementary award whereby a further relief is being granted beyond that granted in the original award \\nthe original award was completed and signed by the tribunal and it can not be reopened now except for the limited purpose of rule 31 in travelling outside and beyond the terms of the original award the tribunal has committed a jurisdictional error \\nour attention has been drawn to what purports to be an endorsement by counsel for the appellant on the application dated 22nd december1978 filed by the union before the tribunal to the effect that the appellant would submit to whatever the tribunal decided and it is urged that the appellant is bound by the order made on the application \\nit is an accepted principle that consent by a party can not confer jurisdiction on a court \\nwhat is without jurisdiction will remain so \\nin the circumstances the order of 22nd december1978 is invalid so far as it amends paragraph 23 of the original award \\nthe corrigendum amending the award in consequence is liable to be quashed \\nthe second contention of the appellant is entitled to succeed \\ni shall now consider civil appeal no 2300 of 1979 filed by the workmen \\nthe only contention of the workmen is that the tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index \\nit is wrong in principle it is said to provide a fixed dearness allowance \\nreliance was placed on the hindustan times ltd new delhi v their workmen 1964 1 scr 234 1962 indlaw sc 436247 where it was observed by this court that dearness allowance should not remain fixed at any figure but should be on a sliding scale in order to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living \\nreference was also made to bengal chemical pharmaceutical works limited v its workmen \\n2 scr 113 1968 indlaw sc 183 now it is not a universal rule that the dearness allowance should in all cases be correlated with the cost of living index \\nthe tribunal in the present case considered the matter and found it sufficient and in accord with justice that the wage scales should be restructured with suitable increments provided therein \\nit noted that dearness allowance was being granted by the appellant at 10 of the salary subject to a minimum of rs 50 and house rent allowance at 30 of the basic salary \\nhaving regard to the not inconsiderable improvement in the level of the basic wage it observed that there would be a consequent increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance \\nin view of the increase so secured the tribunal rejected the suggestion that a slab system should be introduced in the dearness allowance or that there should be any other modification of the principle on which dearness allowance was being presently granted \\nit declared that the cumulative effect of an improved wage structure together with dearness allowance operating on a slab system would throw an impossible burden of about rs 1 crore on the financial capacity of the appellant \\nit was open to the tribunal to adopt the position which it did \\nif the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered \\nthe award is a composite document in which the several elements of increased wage scales larger increments longer span of 20 years for earning increments dearness allowance at 10 of the basic wage besides several other benefits have been integrated into a balanced arrangement in keeping with what the tribunal has found to be the financial capacity of the appellant \\nit is not possible to maintain one part of the award and supersede another \\naccordingly the appeal filed by the workmen must fail \\nin the result civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 is allowed in part insofar that the order dated 22nd december1978 of the industrial tribunal maharashtra bombay is quashed to the extent that it modifies the original award dated 20th december1978and the corrigendum made consequent thereto is also quashed \\ncivil appeal no 2300 of 1979 is dismissed \\nthere is no order as to costs \\nchinnappa reddy j we have had the advantage of perusing the judgment prepared by our learned brother pathak j we agree with him that civil appeal no 2300 of 1979 should be dismissed \\nwe also agree with him that civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 should also be dismissed in so far as it relates to the award dated december 201978 however we do not agree with our learned brother that civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 should be allowed in so far as it relates to the order dated december 221978 of the industrial tribunal which purports to correct the award dated december 201978 in our opinion civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 should be dismissed in its entirety \\nwe do not propose to give our reasons to the extent we are in agreement with pathak j and we propose to state our reasons for the disagreement only \\nit is needless to recapitulate all the basic facts which have been set out in the judgment of pathak j the award of the industrial tribunal was made on december 201978 on december 221978 that is to say two days after the award was made and when everything must have been fresh to the minds of the tribunal the respective parties and their advocates the employees union made an application under rule 31 of the industrial disputes bombay rules1957 seeking a correction of an error which it was claimed had crept into the award \\nthe application was as follows in the above reference your honour was pleased to pass an award on 20th december1978 \\nin the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance \\nfurther it appears that the tribunal intended to grant the increase of rs 150 to each draughtsman and rs 100 to all other workmen in their basic pay \\nthe union therefore prays the honourable tribunal to clarify the position and correct the award accordingly \\non this application the advocate for the employer company made the following endorsement submitted to whatever this honourable tribunal desires to do \\nthereafter the tribunal made an order on the same day in the following terms there can be no doubt that a flat increase of rs 150 to each of the employees in the category of draftsmen and of rs 100 to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award \\nthis order was made in the presence of shri manak gagrat advocate for the company and shri n p mehta advocate for the workmen \\nthe endorsement made on the application by the advocate for the company does not indicate that the company had any objection to the award being corrected as sought by the employees union \\non the other hand the endorsement reads as if there was tacit agreement on the part of the company to the correction sought by the union \\nthe order dated december 221978 of the tribunal also does not reveal that there was any opposition by the company to the application for correcting the award \\neven so we propose to examine whether the correction sought by the employees union was within the bounds of the authority of the tribunal or whether it was in effect a fresh award \\nthe primary and basic question considered by the industrial tribunal in making the award dated december 201978 was the question of revision of the wage scales \\nimplicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage scales and flat or ad hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary \\nit can not possibly be doubted that an industrial tribunal deciding upon the wage scales of the employees of an establishment would have full liberty to propose ad hoc increase of salaries as part of the revision of wages \\nnor can it be doubted that fitment into the revised pay scales is certainly a part of the revision of pay scales \\nthis in our opinion is elementary and fundamental to the jurisdiction of the industrial tribunal in revising wage scales \\nin the present case the industrial tribunal on a consideration of the material placed before it came to the conclusion that the company was in an undoubted position to bear the additional financial burden \\nat the end of paragraph 15 of the award the tribunal stated but there can be no doubt that the company can very well bear the additional burden \\nthe question is what should be the extent of such burden \\nat the end of paragraph 18 of the award the tribunal said a mere reading of exhibit u 15 will immediately dispel the misgivings about the future of the present company \\nfor some years to come this is likely to be one of the few consulting engineers who will be securing major contracts \\nagain in paragraph 19 it was said i have no doubt that the present company would be able to bear the additional burden for the years to come \\nthis is further borne out from the trading results of the company for the year 1968 69 to 1977 the profits have increased all along \\nthe copy of the letter dated july 231973alongwith \\nthe annexures from the company to the director general posts telegraphs delhi ex \\nc 27 indicates the important projects the company was handling in india and abroad and the amount of foreign exchange earned and repatriated \\ni will therefore proceed on the ground that the present company can bear the additional financial burden \\nfinally at the end of paragraph 21 \\nthe tribunal said in view of this position the company can easily bear some burden that might fall as a result of the upward revision of the wage scales \\nthe question is to what extent the relief should be given to the employees \\nafter expressing himself in categoric terms about the capacity of the company to bear the additional financial burden the tribunal went on to say i only propose to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category \\nthe tribunal then considered the question whether draftsmen should get a higher flat increase and the question whether the existing scheme of dearness allowance should be revised \\nthe tribunal then observed the flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draftsmen and rs 100 in the case of the other categories would be fair \\nthereafter various other matters were considered and finally the tribunal revised the wage scales in the manner already mentioned by my brother pathak j the question of fitment was then considered in the following manner fitment if as on 1st january1976an employee is drawing a salary less than the beginning of the respective grade he should be first stepped up to the beginning of the grade \\nif the pay of an employee does not coincide with any step in the revised pay scale and falls between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay of that employee shall be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale \\nafter fixing the salary of the employees in the scales as above the employees should be given increments in the new scales as noted below i employees who have completed 5 years or more as on 1st january19763 increments \\nii employees who have completed 4 years of service as on 1st january19762 increments \\nall other employees with more than one year  s service shall be given one increment \\nnow if without any flat or ad hoc increase of salary the workmen were to be fitted into the revised scales of pay it would obviously result in serious anomalous situations \\nin the case of several senior employees the revised scale would yield but a very small and almost a token increase in the size of the pay packet whereas the junior employees would get a large benefit \\nwhile workmen raising industrial disputes for revision of wage scales are certainly minded about their future prospects in the matter of wages they surely would be more concerned with the immediate benefits according to them \\nthat was why the industrial tribunal thought that an all round flat increase of rs 150 in the case of draftsmen and rs 100 in the case of other workmen was called for \\nit was clearly so intended by the tribunal as is evident from the reference to flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draftsmen and rs 100 in the case of the other categories \\nsince there was to be a flat increase of rs 150 and rs 100 in the case of draftsmen and other workmen respectively the revised wage scale had necessarily to commence with figures rs 150 and rs 100 above the existing wage scales \\nimmediately after the award was pronounced while the iron was still hot as it were the employees apparently realised that the employer might take advantage of the circumstance that it was not clearly mentioned in the award that all the employees were to get additional pay of rs 150 and rs 100 respectively and might contend that the tribunal had only revised the wage scales by increasing the salary on entry into the service and restructuring the scale of pay and never granted any ad hoc increase of salary to all employees \\ntherefore they filed an application before the tribunal for correcting the award so as to bring out what was intended \\nas it has now turned out what the employees apparently suspected the employer might contend is precisely what the employer is not contending though the employer did not choose to so contend before the industrial tribunal itself when the employees filed the application for rectification \\nthe application before the tribunal was filed under rule 31 of the bombay industrial disputes rules 1957which is as follows \\na board court labour court tribunal or arbitrator may at any time suo moto or on an application made by any of the parties concerned may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any proceedings report award or as the case may be decision \\nthe omission of the words to each employee first after the figure rs 150 and again after the figure rs 100 was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the tribunal was entitled to correct \\nwe are unable to see how it can be held to be otherwise \\nwe are not impressed with the submission of the learned counsel for the company that the corrigendum was in effect a fresh award \\nwe therefore see no ground for quashing the order dated december 221978 of the tribunal \\nthe result of the foregoing discussion is that civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 has to be dismissed in its entirety \\nwe have already indicated that we agree with our brother pathak j that the appeal civil appeal no 2300 of 1979 filed by the workmen should also be dismissed \\nwhile we find lot of force in the submission of shri v m tarkunde learned counsel for the workmen that dearness allowance linked to cost of living index is ordinarily the best and the most scientific method of computing dearness allowance it can not always be said that an illegality warranting interference under article 136 is committed if some other method is adopted \\nthe tribunal has given satisfactory reason for adopting a different mode and we are not disposed to interfere with the award of the tribunal \\nin the result both the appeals are dismissed without any order as to costs \\nthe order of the court was as follows \\nin view of the opinion of the majority both the appeals are dismissed and there is no order as to costs \\n\",\n          \"ujjagar singh the appellant herein a resident of village bangawali tehsil malerkotla was tried and convicted by the additional sessions judge sangrur for the murder of his niece mukhtiar kaur and was awarded the death penalty \\nin addition he was convicted for an offence punishable section 376 of the ipc and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to a fine of rs 5 000 and in default of payment to undergo further r i for one year and section 309 of the ipc to a sentence of simple imprisonment for one year \\nthe aforesaid convictions and sentences have been maintained by the high court and the matter is before us in these proceedings by way of special leave \\nthe facts of the case are as under \\nat about 2 00 p m on 10th november 2002 a boy whose identity is not forthcoming informed satnam singh pw2 that an incident of firing had taken place in the house of ujjagar singh situated in the fields on the outskirts of the village \\nsatnam singh conveyed this information to sarpanch jora singh pw1 who was attending a marriage at that time \\njora singh accompanied by gurdeep singh pw3 thereupon rushed to ujjagar singh  s house and found mukhtiar kaur lying dead with a gun shot injury and the appellant also with a gun shot injury lying unconscious on the ground in the adjoining room \\njora singh and gurdeep singh immediately removed ujjagar singh to the civil hospital dhuri in the jeep belonging to kulwant singh pw4 \\njora singh also met inspector harjinder pal singh pw14 at 4 40 p m near the hospital who recorded his statement at that place and with his endorsement exhibit p a sent it to police station dhuri where the formal fir was registered at about 4 45 p m with the special report being delivered to the illaka magistrate at dhuri itself at 6 20 p m the same evening \\nthe facts as narrated were that arjan singh of village bangawali had three sons puran singh ujjagar singh appellant and ajmer singh \\npuran singh had died about 20 years earlier leaving behind his wife two sons and a daughter mukhtiar kaur \\nthe two sons and the wife also died long before the incident and mukhtiar kaur the sole surviving member of this branch of the family had been married to balwinder singh pw9 about 9 or 10 years earlier \\npuran singh had however transferred 30 or 35 bighas of agricultural land falling to his share after the death of his father in the name of the appellant  s sons by a collusive decree in the year 1994 and the suggestion was that this transaction had been objected to by mukhtiar kaur who was demanding that the land be returned to her \\nit appears that mukhtiar kaur  s relations with her in laws had got strained and she had left her matrimonial home and come to live with ujjagar singh her uncle 7 or 8 months earlier and the suggestion was that mukhtiar kaur had been killed by the appellant with his licensed gun and he had thereafter attempted to commit suicide \\nhaving recorded the aforesaid facts in the fir pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh reached the place of incident and lifted one spent 12 bore cartridge case shaktiman make from near mukhtiar kaur  s dead body and one dbbl gun from the place where ujjagar singh appeared to have been shot and another spent cartridge case was recovered from the right barrel of the gun \\nafter completion of the investigation at the spot mukhtiar kaur  s dead body was sent for its post mortem examination \\nthe post mortem examination was also conducted by pw5 dr ishwar singh medical officer civil hospital along with dr harwinder kaur pw17 and it was found that mukhtiar kaur had two gunshot injuries on her dead body a wound of entry on the back of right side of chest 2 cm x 1 cm with margining and blackening and a corresponding exit wound of 5 cm x 3 5 cm to the front of the right side of the chest \\ndr harwinder kaur aforesaid also took swabs from the vagina of the deceased and as per the chemical examiner  s report dated 2 1 2003 semen was found on the swab taken from the vagina and from the underwear that mukhtiar kaur had been wearing at the time of her death \\nthe weapon and the recovered cartridge cases had also been sent to the forensic science laboratory which in its report dated 4 8 2004 opined that the crime cartridge case ci could have been fired by the right barrel of the weapon whereas the crime cartridge case c2 had been fired from the right barrel \\non the completion of the investigation a charge sheet under sections 302 376 and 309 of the ipc was filed against the accused and as he pleaded not guilty he was brought to trial \\nduring the trial jora singh pw1 satnam singh pw2 gurdeep singh pw3 and kulwant singh pw4 resiled from their statements given to the police and were declared hostile \\nbalwinder singh pw9 however supported the prosecution case deposing that the land had in fact been got transferred from gurmail kaur mother of mukhtiar kaur to ujjagar singh by fraud and mukhtiar kaur was therefore entitled to its return \\nhe also deposed that mukhtiar kaur had told him some time earlier that the accused had been beating her and had also committed sexual intercourse with her and that at about 11 p m on 10 11 2002 karam singh pw10 had informed him as to what had transpired on which he along with his father hamir singh pw12 and several others had rushed to bangawali \\npw10 karam singh aforesaid confirmed the story given by balwinder singh \\nthe prosecution also relied on the statements of dr vijay kumar pw6 of the civil hospial dhuri who testified that the appellant had been brought to the hospital at about 2 45 p m on 10 11 2002 with a serious gun shot injury dr ripan miglani pw15 of the dayanand medical college hospital ludhiana who deposed that he had been admitted to the department of neuro surgery with a serious gun shot injury and dr sanjay uppal pw16 a plastic surgeon who disclosed that the appellant had been under his treatment for almost 5 weeks and the burnt area around the firearm injury had been removed by him \\nthe prosecution also placed reliance on the statement of asi jasbir singh pw11 who had accompanied inspector harjinder pal singh pw14 to the place of incident and supported the recoveries made from the spot \\nthe prosecution case was then put to the accused and his statement recorded section \\n313 of the cr \\np c in reply to question 33 he stated as under i am innocent \\ni have been implicated falsely in this case \\ni was treating mukhtiar kaur as my daughter and loved her as my daughter \\nfalse allegations have been levelled against me \\ni never harassed mukhtiar kaur nor ever got her land mutated from her mother by fraud \\ni have not killed mukhtiar kaur \\nmother of mukhtiar kaur got the land mutated by her own free will and mukhtiar kaur had no dispute about it \\nbalwinder singh her husband was addicted to vices and used to beat her due to which she used to remain under depression and sick generally and used to come to me as my daughter \\nmy house kothi is situated on the outer skirts of village bangawali and door planks had not been fixed so far to rooms \\nsome body suddenly came and fired at me \\ni fell down on the ground and became unconscious \\ntherefore i could not see what had happened to mukhtiar kaur as she was in other room \\nlater on i came to know that some body had fired at her and she died \\ni regained consciousness in hospital \\nthe story of rape by me with her has been fabricated by her husband as he is inimical towards me \\neven i do not know who took me to hospital \\ni have been implicated in this case falsely \\nthe trial court and the high court relying on the circumstances available on the evidence convicted and sentenced the appellant as already mentioned above \\nmr goburdhan the learned counsel for the accused has raised several arguments in the course of hearing \\nhe has pointed out that there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that mukhtiar kaur had been subjected to rape and in this view of the matter the very basis for the imposition of the death penalty was not made out \\nhe has also pointed out that there were no eye witnesses to the incident and the 4 witnesses i e jora singh and others who had reached the place of incident and carried the injured appellant to the hospital had also resiled and as the prosecution story now rested on circumstantial evidence alone it was imperative for the investigating officer to have taken the finger prints from the weapon and that in any case the recovery of the spent cartridges and the gun were clearly suspicious as the weapon had been sent to the laboratory after an inordinate delay \\nit has also been submitted that in a case of attempted suicide a firearm must of necessity be used from a very close range and the absence of any blackening charring or burning around the wound on ujjagar singh clearly ruled out the possibility of such an attempt \\nit has finally been submitted that the land had been transferred in the name of ujjagar singh  s sons in the year 1994 by gurmail kaur mother of mukhtiar kaur by a collusive decree and there was no evidence to show that mukhtiar kaur had ever displayed any unhappiness or made any complaint to any person or any authority with regard to the decree and as such the very basis of the prosecution story did not exist \\nthe learned state counsel has however supported the judgment of the courts below \\nhe has further emphasized that the prosecution  s case stood proved from various factors including the medical evidence the reports of the forensic science laboratory the chemical examiner from the post mortem reports and the recovery of the gun and cartridges \\nwe have heard the learned counsel for the parties and gone through the record \\nwe first take up for consideration the question of the conviction section 376 of the ipc \\nwe find from the medical evidence and from the chemical examiner  s reports that the vaginal swab and clothes taken from the dead body did indicate the presence of semen \\nthere is however absolutely no evidence to suggest even assuming that the intercourse had been committed by the appellant that he had done so without mukhtiar kaur  s consent or against her will \\nsome suspicions of rape could perhaps have been raised had some tell tale injuries been detected on mukhtiar kaur  s person but we find that the two injuries other than the gun shot wounds i e injury no 3 being on the left pinna and \\nno 4 an abrasion near the right eye do not indicate any attempt to rape or the commission of rape \\nit is also significant that the investigators had made no attempt whatsoever to have the appellant medically examined to ascertain his capacity to perform sexual intercourse \\nthe learned state counsel relying on the statement of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh has however submitted that the examination had not been possible as the appellant had received a very serious gun shot injury and was hanging between life and death \\nwe agree with the submission of the learned counsel that an examination could not have been carried out immediately \\nbut we see no justification in the omission of the prosecution to have him examined after he had recovered his health and been discharged from hospital \\nwe are further of the opinion that even assuming for a moment that sexual intercourse between the two had indeed taken place it can not be said from the evidence before us that it was without the consent or against the wishes of mukhtiar kaur \\nwe therefore find that ujjagar singh  s conviction section 376 of the ipc can not be sustained \\nmr goburdhan has placed great emphasis on the fact that as the four witnesses who had reached the place of incident i e jora singh satnam singh gurdeep singh and kulwant singh had resiled from their statements and had disowned their initial stories the prosecution had of necessity to rely on circumstantial evidence and if the chain of circumstances remained incomplete or even if one link in the chain was broken the prosecution must fail \\nhe has also relied on the judgment of balu sonba shinde v state of maharashtra 2002 7 scc 543 2002 indlaw sc 1923 to contend that it was open to the accused to take advantage insofar as possible from the statement of a witness though declared hostile and the four witnesses having disowned the prosecution story and having given a different version the appellant was entitled to derive such benefit as possible in this situation \\nthe learned state counsel has however emphasized that both the trial court and the high court had for good reasons opined that the circumstances made out a case for conviction and the accused having given a counter version some obligation lay on him as well to explain the circumstances against him inasmuch that admittedly he and the victim were alone in the house at the time of the incident \\nreliance for this argument has been placed on the decision of raj kumar prasad tamarkar v state of bihar anr 20071 \\nscale 19 2007 indlaw sc 5 \\nwe have considered their arguments very carefully \\nin mahmood v state of u p 1976 1 scc 542 1975 indlaw sc 643 it has been observed that in a case dependent wholly on circumstantial evidence the court must be satisfied athat the circumstances from which the inference of guilt is to be drawn have been fully established by unimpeachable evidence beyond a shadow of doubt bthat the circumstances are of a determinative tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused and cthat the circumstances taken collectively are incapable of explanation on any reasonable hypothesis save that of the guilt sought to be proved against him \\nin this case this court held that the omission of the prosecution inter alia to have the finger prints found on the alleged murder weapon was fatal to the prosecution story \\nin 1984 4 scc 116 sharad birdhichand sarda v state of maharashtra 1984 indlaw sc 432 this court discussed the ratio of the judgments in hanumant v state of m p air 1952 sc 343

maharashtra 1973 2 scc 793 1973 indlaw sc 181 and observed thus a close analysis of this decision would show that the following conditions must be fulfilled before a case against an accused can be said to be fully established 1the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established \\nit may be noted here that this court indicated that the circumstances concerned must or should and not may be established \\nthere is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between may be proved and must be or should be proved as was held by this court in shivaji sahabrao bobade v state of maharashtra 1973 indlaw sc 181 where the following observations were made \\ncertainly it is a primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and the mental distance between may be is long and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions \\n2the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused that is to say they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty 3the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency 4they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved and 5there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused \\nmr goburdhan has also cited mahmood v state of u p 1976 1 scc 542

sc 144 in support of his plea relating to the evaluation of circumstantial evidence \\nthese judgments have broadly followed the principles laid down in the judgments referred to above and need not therefore be dealt with us in extenso \\nit must nonetheless be emphasized that whether a chain is complete or not would depend on the facts of each case emanating from the evidence and no universal yardstick should ever be attempted \\nit is in this background that we must examine the circumstances in the present case \\na few facts stand out from the prosecution story \\nfirst the place of incident being adjoining rooms in the residential house of the appellant and the fact that the alleged murder weapon is his licensed dbbl gun is proved on record \\nthe evidence also reveals that the appellant was living in the premises along with his wife mother and son and two daughters who were studying outside the village were frequent visitors but it is the admitted position that nobody but the appellant and the deceased were present at the time of incident \\nit is also clear from the evidence that the two spent cartridge cases recovered one from near mukhtiar kaur  s dead body and the second from the right barrel of the gun lying near the appellant had been sent to the forensic science laboratory which opined that one of the cartridges had been fired from the gun and the other could have been fired therefrom \\nmr goburdhan has however laid great emphasis on the fact that no reference to the gun or cartridges had been made in the inquest report and that in any case the weapon and the spent cartridges had been sent to the laboratory belatedly \\nwe are of the opinion however that no adverse inference can be drawn from either of these circumstances \\nthe aforesaid articles had been carried to the laboratory by constable gopal singh who in his affidavit dated 17th march 2003 deposed that he had first taken the articles to the laboratory on 9th december 2002 but they had been returned by the director on the ground that the seals affixed thereon were not of the requisite number and that after removing the objections raised by the director the articles aforesaid had been returned to the laboratory on 18th december 2002 \\ngopal singh was cross examined by the prosecution \\nand but for some inconsequential questions put to him with regard to the seals not even a suggestion was made that the aforesaid articles had in any way been tampered with \\nit is true as contended that in column 22 of the inquest report which refers to the articles found near the dead body there is no reference to the spent cartridges or the murder weapon but we find from a perusal of the site plan exh \\npjj prepared by the investigating officer inspector harjinder pal singh pw14 on 10th november 2002 that the weapon is shown lying close to the place where the appellant had been found unconscious and a spent cartridge recovered from near the dead body of mukhtiar kaur \\nit has also been submitted by mr goburdhan that there appeared to be no motive for the incident as the story about mukhtiar kaur  s unhappiness about the transfer of land to the sons of ujjagar singh sought to be proved by pw9 balwinder singh and pw10 karam singh had been disbelieved by the high court with the observation that the statements of these two witnesses could not be relied upon \\nit is true that in a case relating to circumstantial evidence motive does assume great importance but to say that the absence of motive would dislodge the entire prosecution story is perhaps giving this one factor an importance which is not due and to use the clichi \\nthe motive is in the mind of the accused and can seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy \\nthere is however a hint in the testimony of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh that his enquiries had revealed that the accused was having illicit relations with mukhtiar kaur and we can assume that some thing untoward had happened which could have triggered the volatile and hostile incident \\nthere could perhaps be some truth in this suggestion as it is significant that though the appellant had an extended family living with him i e mother wife son living in the village and two young daughters who were studying outside and residing in a hostel but were frequent visitors home yet none of them has come forth to depose in his favour \\nto our mind therefore this is yet another circumstance inculpating the accused \\nmr goburdhan has also laid much stress on the apparent discordance between the prosecution story and the medical evidence and has argued that had the accused attempted to commit suicide the gun shot must of necessity had to be fired from a very close range on which the wound would have marks of burning or charring and that in any event a full blooded shot from a very close range would have torn his face apart \\nhe has in this connection referred us to the statement of dr ripan miglani pw15 and the wound found on the appellant at the time of his medical examination in the department of surgery of the dayanand medical college hospital ludhiana which was about 15 x 8 cm curvilinear wound present on the left half of face extending upto bone \\nno blackening or foreign body was visible \\nunderlying muscles were exposed and contamination was present \\nhe has thus urged that the absence of any blackening underlined the argument that the shot had been fired from some distance and as such an attempt at suicide was clearly to be ruled out \\nhe has also drawn our attention to the cross examination of the doctor wherein he reiterated that there was no visible blackening and that it was not possible for him to say whether the injury was suicidal or otherwise \\nthe learned state counsel has however relied on the statement of pw16 dr sanjay uppal who was apparently the first doctor to have examined the appellant wherein he clearly testified that the blackened portion around the firearm injury had been removed by him \\nwe are therefore of the opinion that this statement falsifies mr goburdhan  s argument on this aspect \\nit is also significant that the shot had apparently travelled upwards skirting the mandible through the flesh of the cheek in an upward direction with minimal damage to the bone structure and it is indeed providential that the appellant got away with only an injury albeit a very serious one \\nthe fact that the shot was fired from below going upwards is also supported by the site plan exh \\npjj wherein marks of a shot hitting the roof were seen at point e whereas the appellant was found lying at point d in the same room \\nit is therefore apparent that the weapon had indeed been fired by the appellant from a close range and that the blackened portion around the wound had been removed by dr sanjay uppal \\nthe learned state counsel has emphasized that in the light of the admitted position that the accused and the deceased were the only ones present at the time of incident and that the accused had projected a counter story some credible explanation was also expected from him \\nreference has been made to raj kumar prasad tamarkar  s case2007 indlaw sc 5 supra wherein in circumstances surprisingly akin to the present matter this court had the following observations to make the conspectus of the events which had been noticed by the learned sessions judge as also by the high court categorically go to show that at the time when the occurrence took place the deceased and the respondent only were in the bedroom and the terrace connecting the same \\nthere was no other person \\nthe cause of death of the deceased usha devi i e by a gun shot injury is not disputed \\nthe fact that the terrace and the bedroom are adjoining each other is not in dispute \\nthe autopsy report shows that a blackening and charring existed so far as injury no i is concerned \\nthe blackening and charring keeping in view the nature of the firearm which is said to have been used clearly go to show that a shot was fired from a short distance \\nblackening or charring is possible when a shot is fired from a distance of about 2 feet to 3 feet \\nit therefore can not be a case where the death might have been caused by somebody by firing a shot at the deceased from a distance of more than 6 feet \\nthe place of injury is also important \\nthe lacerated wound was found over grabella middle of forehead \\nit goes a long way to show that the same must have been done by a person who wanted to kill the deceased from a short distance \\nthere was thus a remote possibility of causation of such type of injury by any other person who was not in the terrace \\nonce the prosecution has been able to show that at the relevant time the room and terrace were in exclusive occupation of the couple the burden of proof lay upon the respondent to show under what circumstances death was caused to his wife \\nthe onus was on him \\nhe failed to discharge the same \\nwe have considered the submission of the state counsel very carefully \\nit is true that it is generally for the prosecution to prove its case beyond doubt but in circumstances such as the present one some explanation is also due from an accused in order to absolve himself from suspicion of the crime \\nin his statement section p c his positive stand was that he alone had been in the house with mukhtiar kaur when she had been killed and indeed as per exhibit p jj mukhtiar kaur  s body had been found only one karam 5 feet away from the place where the appellant lay injured \\nit must be emphasized that but for this self serving statement made by the appellant there is nothing on record to support his positive stance \\neven otherwise we are of the opinion that had the shot been fired by some intruder the direction would have been more or less horizontal and parallel to the ground and not from down upwards with the pellets hitting the jaw skirting the cheek and hitting the roof at point \\ne in modi  s medical jurisprudence and toxicology 23rd edition at page 765 while dealing with identification of homicidal and suicidal injuries it has been observed that a suicidal firearm wound is usually a contact wound situated on the side of the temple depending on which hand was used to shoot himself in the centre of the forehead the roof of the mouth in the chest or epigastrium in front or the left side and some times under the chin \\nthe firearm is usually fired at close range \\na small weapon like a revolver or a pistol is held in the hand while a rifle or a shot gun is supported on the ground or against the wall \\nsometimes the firing is done by pulling a string tied to the trigger by the big toe \\nthe skin around the entry wound shows characteristic blackening scorching and tattooing \\nin such cases the hand used to steady the weapon at the muzzle may be blackened and scorched and may also be stained with squirting of the blood from the injured arteries \\nin homicidal and accidental shooting the wound may be on any part of the body and the path of the bullet may be in any direction \\nhomicidal shooting by dacoits is not uncommon in india and they are known to make their own firearms \\nimmediate death following a firearm wound is uncommon and even when vital organs are injured a person may be capable of doing extraordinary things \\nsometimes firearm wounds may look like knife slashes or a bullet hole may resemble a penetrating stab wound if the bullet strikes the head of shoulder at an angle or when an unstable bullet registers a broadside hit \\na fateh describes a rare homicidal gun shot wound of the mouth where the entry wound was in the tongue and the direction was horizontally backward while in suicidal wounds the direction is upwards entrance would be in the palate or posterior pharynx \\ndr b r sharma in his book forensic science in criminal investigation and trials fourth edition at page 1160 too has delineated the circumstances that could indicate suicide and while referring to the site of the injury has observed certain sites are predominantly used by suicides for self inflicted injuries \\nfor example with firearm temple forehead mouth and chest are the favourite sites \\nwith knife throat and wrist are the favourite sites \\nhesitation injuries are also observed in some suicide cases \\nit is therefore clear to us that the story of unknown assailants entering the house and causing mukhtiar kaur  s murder etcetera has to be ruled out and that the prosecution story that it was the appellant who had first shot mukhtiar kaur and then attempted to commit suicide stands proved \\nwe also find that no part of the evidence of the hostile witnesses comes to the aid of the appellant \\nthe question now arises as to the sentence that should be imposed on the appellant \\nit would be seen that both the sessions court and the high court were appalled by the allegations and findings of incestuous rape and murder \\nwe are however of the opinion as already noted above that a case of rape has not been made out \\nin this background the death sentence is not called for \\nwe accordingly acquit the appellant of the charge section 376 of the ipc but maintain his conviction for the other offences but commute his death sentence to life \\nwith this modification the appeal is dismissed \\nappeal dismissed \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"expected_output\",\n

centrifugal pumps also under the mark  field marshall  allegedly on the premise that the first respondent is the proprietor of the said mark by reason of long user and thus acquired a reputation in that behalf a legal notice was issued upon it questioning its right to use the said mark in respect of centrifugal pumps by the appellant laying a claim that it had been using the said mark since 1963  respondent no 1 thereafter filed a suit in the delhi high court for grant of a decree of permanent injunction being suit no 2408 of 1985 alleging infringement of the said mark and or claiming right of passing off in respect thereof  an ex parte order of injunction was passed on 19 12 1985 against the defendant  meanwhile a temporary ex parte injunction is issued against the defendants restraining them from manufacturing or selling either themselves or through any dealer or representative diesel oil engines or parts thereof with the trade mark  field marshal  and or any other trade mark identical therewith and all goods falling in cl 7 of the trade and merchandise mark rules  the second rectification application filed by the first respondent however was transferred to the intellectual property appellate board  the said application was dismissed  a writ petition was filed there against by the first respondent  a learned single judge of the delhi high court however refused to stay the operation of the order of the board dated 27 10 2004 an appeal was preferred there against  the division bench of the high court thereafter while disposing of both the writ petition and the letters patent appeal allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of the board and directed it to adjudicate the dispute on merits  the said order of the division bench is under challenge in this appeal   argument appellant s counsel appeared on that date and inter alia contended that presently it was the registered owner of the trade mark which was sought to be cancelled  in view of that statement a submission was made on behalf of the first respondent that it may be permitted to withdraw the petition with liberty to file a fresh petition on the same cause of action   issue whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case the application under s 46 1  b  was maintainable  whether  to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps  goods  so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned   analysis the core question which arises for our consideration is as to whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case the application under s 46 1  b  was maintainable  indisputably the scope of the provisions for removal from register in terms of s 46 and 56 of the act stand on different footings  whereas s 46 had a limited application s 56 of the act is wider in nature  concededly cl  a  of sub s  1  of s 46 is not attracted in the case  the prayer in the application was to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps  goods  so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned  it is in the aforementioned situation it is advisable to determine the meaning of the words  for the time being  occurring in s 46 1  b  of the act  two interpretations thereto which are possible are   1  the said words would denote non use of the trade mark in relation to the goods by the appellant for a period of five years or longer  and  2  the mark had not been used for a period of five years or longer either by the present proprietor thereof or his predecessor  the words  for the time being  would mean differently in different situations  it may mean  the moment or existing position  as was held by this court in the case of jivendra nath kaul v  collector district magistrate and anr   1992  3 scc 576 1992 indlaw sc 1107  or in the context of cl  22  of art 366 of the constitution as has been held in h h maharajadhiraja  madhav rao jivaji rao scindia bahadur of gwalior h h maharajadhiraja  maharana shri bhagwat singhji bahadur of udaipur v  union of india and anr  air 1971  sc 530 1970

with authority to recognize or not to recognize a ruler arbitrarily   the expression  for them time being  predicts that there shall be a ruler of the indian state that if the first recognized ruler dies or ceases to be a ruler a successor shall be appointed and that there shall not be more rulers than one at a given time  the person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods as that of the registered owner  it confers an exclusive right of use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in which the trade mark is registered  whether s 46 1  b  read with s 48 of the act would bring within its purview not only a registered proprietor but also the proprietor who had otherwise acquired a right would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case  the court while construing a statute takes into consideration the parliamentary intent in amending the provisions thereof  it seeks to enhance the period of moratorium of use of the registered trade mark from one month to three months so as to prevent speculative assignment  thus a case of speculative assignment is specifically required to be made out  such an application may be maintainable in terms of s 56 of the act but strictly not in terms of s 46 1  b  thereof and that too in the absence of the original registered proprietor  attention has again been drawn to a passage from  law of trade marks    geographical indications  by shri k c kailasam wherein the judgment of the tribunal has been criticized in the following terms    from the above legislative intent it would seem that the period of non use of the trade mark is to be reckoned continuously from the date of its registration  in the case of american home products corporation v  mac laboratories pvt ltd  rendered under the 1958 act it was held by the supreme court that  the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the register has only to prove  such continuous non user   it would appear that neither the u k act nor the indian act at any time envisaged that the commencement of 5 year period of non use is to be delinked from the date of registration of the mark so as to give a fresh lease of life to the registration every time there is change in the ownership of the mark  if that be so any registered proprietor could easily defeat an application for rectification by assigning the mark to some other person to have a fresh period of 5 years from the date of assignment and thus effectively frustrate the very object of the provision in s 47 1  a  and  b   further it is to be noted that an assignment is subject to  the provisions of the act and any rights vested in any other person   see  s 37  the assignor cannot obviously transfer more rights than he himself has to the assignee under the act  an assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses   statute interpretation of the provisions of s 46 1  b   and section 48 of the trade and merchandise marks act 1958  \",\n          \"facts tata consultant engineers was a partnership firm but subsequently the partnership was dissolved and in 1974 the undertaking became one of the divisions of tata sons limited  it functions as a consulting organisation and a service industry and does not manufacture any product or carry on trade its work force consists of engineers and supervisors and different categories of workmen  the tata consultant employees union served a charter of demands in july 1974 on the appellant and as their demands were not accepted and conciliation proceedings proved fruitless the state government made a reference of the dispute under s 10 1  d  industrial tribunal maharashtra for adjudication  the union filed a statement before the tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments  it was urged that the efficiency bar as a feature of the wage scales should be removed  the dearness allowance it was claimed should be granted on a slab system  the claim of the union was resisted by the appellant who maintained that the existing wage scales were fair and reasonable on a region cum industry basis and that it would not be possible for the appellant to bear the additional financial burden if the demands of the union were accepted  the appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised  there was no separate dearness allowance until january 1977 when it was introduced for the first time  house rent allowance was also paid  dearness allowance became payable at 10  of the basic wage subject to a minimum of rs 50  and house rent allowance at 30  of the basic salary  the tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years there was definite need for revising the wage scales  it also laid down the principle enabling the actual fitment of the workmen in their respective wage scales as on that date and also provided for the number of increments to which they would be entitled having regard to the period of completed service  two days after the award was made an application was made by the union stating   in the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22 in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance   the workmen have filed an appeal by special leave  in which they have challenged the rejection by the tribunal of their claim in respect of dearness allowance which they contend should be pegged to the cost of living index and should not be a fixed amount   argument considering the appeal of tata consulting engineers first the contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal erred in making the wage scales retrospective and in any event in ranging the retrospectivity back to 1st january 1976  the learned counsel for the appellant had covered a wide field but in the end he states that the appellant is aggrieved by two matters only  one is the retrospectivity attached to the revised wage scales and the other is the flat increase given to each employee of rs 150  in the category of draughtsmen and rs 100  in other categories resulting from the order dated 22nd december 1978  it is urged that the amendment results in the inclusion of a flat increase of rs 150  to each workman in the case of draughtsman and rs 100  to each workman in the case of other categories a result wholly unwarranted it is said by the intent of the original award and therefore falling beyond the jurisdiction of the tribunal  the only contention of the workmen is that the tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index   issue the primary and basic question considered by the industrial tribunal in making the award dated december 20 1978 was the question of revision of the wage scales  implicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage scales and flat or ad hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary   analysis it must be remembered that although the wage scales were introduced as long ago as 1973 they were maintained at that level except for a slight revision some time thereafter  no dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time  the cost of living had gone on increasing from 1972 onwards and as the tribunal has found the dearness allowance and house rent allowance made no appreciable impact in neutralising the increasing cost  during all these years the appellant had continued to enjoy increasing profits  nonetheless the emoluments received by the workmen did not receive the impress of the appellant s growing prosperity  the charter of demands was presented by the union in july 1974 and when conciliation proceedings failed the state government made the reference to the industrial tribunal in 1975  they are considerations which cannot be ignored  accordingly the contention raised on behalf of the appellant against retrospectivity of the wage scales must be rejected  the financial capacity of the appellant and the related study of its annual profits from 1968 to 1977 were examined from that view point  the sufficiency of the existing pay scales was considered in detail and regard was had to their original structure and the accretions made subsequently by way of dearness allowance and house rent allowance  for the purpose of restructuring the pay scales the tribunal ruled on the paying capacity of the appellant both with reference to the profits of the preceding year as well as the prospects of the future  the financial capacity as the tribunal observed constituted one of  the principles which are required to be followed in the fixation of the wage structure   no ad hoc increase to the pay of each individual workman was intended  the jurisdiction given to the tribunal by rule 31 is closely circumscribed  it is only a clerical mistake or error which can be corrected and the clerical mistake or error must arise from an accidental slip or omission in the award  an accidental slip or omission implies that something was intended and contrary to that intention what should not have been included has been included or what should have been included has been omitted  it must be a mistake or error amenable to clerical correction only  it must not be a mistake or error which calls for rectification by modification of the conscious adjudication on the issues involved  the omission of the words to each employee first after the figure rs 150  and again after the figure rs 100  was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the tribunal was entitled to correct  it will be noted that the pay scales of different categories were being restructured and the flat increase envisaged there related to an increase in the general pay scales of different categories  individual workmen were not present to the mind of the tribunal  that the increase was pertinent to the general pay scales in the revised wage structure is patently clear from a comparison of the existing pay scales and the revised pay scales  the comparative table of existing pay scales and the revised pay scales has been reproduced earlier  the revised pay scales of all categories except the category of draughtsmen shows an increase of rs 100  in the initial pay fixed in each scale the increase in the case of the category of draughtsmen being rs 150   the amendment made by the tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase this time to each individual workmen  if as the tribunal has stated in the amendment order the increase in paragraph 23 was intended to apply to each individual workmen there is nothing in the body of the award to form the foundation on which the actual figures in the restructured pay scales can be made to rest  there will be no explanation why the initial start of the revised pay scales has been increased by rs 150  in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100  in the case of other categories  considering the fitment of the workman in the revised scales it was stated in the award that a workman found drawing a salary less than the beginning of the grade would be stepped up to the beginning of the grade and if his pay fell between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay was to be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale  reliance was placed on the hindustan times ltd  new delhi v their workmen  1964  1 scr 234 1962 indlaw sc 436 247 where it was observed by this court that dearness allowance should not remain fixed at any figure but should be on a sliding scale in order to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living  now it is not a universal rule that the dearness allowance should in all cases be correlated with the cost of living index  it was open to the tribunal to adopt the position which it did  if the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered  the award is a composite document in which the several elements of increased wage scales larger increments longer span of 20 years for earning increments dearness allowance at 10  of the basic wage besides several other benefits have been integrated into a balanced arrangement in keeping with what the tribunal has found to be the financial capacity of the appellant  it is not possible to maintain one part of the award and supersede another  conspicuous by its absence is any reference to a flat increase in the pay of an individual workmen  we are not impressed with the submission that the corrigendum was in effect a fresh award  we therefore see no ground for quashing the of the tribunal  dearness allowance linked to cost of living index is ordinarily the best and the most scientific method of computing dearness allowance it cannot always be said that an illegality warranting interference under article 136 is committed if some other method is adopted  the tribunal has given satisfactory reason for adopting a different mode and we are not disposed to interfere with the award of the tribunal   statute in making the application of 22nd december 1978 the union invoked the jurisdiction of the tribunal under rule 31 of the industrial disputes  bombay  rules 1957  rule 31 provides  the labour court tribunal or arbitrator may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any award it or he issues  the application before the

ujjagar singh  the appellant herein  was tried and convicted by the additional sessions judge  sangrur for the murder of his niece mukhtiar kaur and was awarded the death penalty  in addition  he was convicted for an offence punishable u s  376 of the ipc and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to a fine of rs 5  000   and in default of payment to undergo further r i  for one year and u s  309 of the ipc to a sentence of simple imprisonment for one year  the aforesaid convictions and sentences have been maintained by the high court and the matter is before us in these proceedings by way of special leave  at about 2 00 p m  on 10th november 2002 a boy whose identity is not forthcoming  informed satnam singh pw2 that an incident of firing had taken place in the house of ujjagar singh   satnam singh conveyed this information to sarpanch jora singh pw1 who was attending a marriage at that time  jora singh accompanied by gurdeep singh pw3 thereupon rushed to ujjagar singh s house and found mukhtiar kaur lying dead with a gun shot injury and the appellant also with a gun shot injury lying unconscious on the ground in the adjoining room  it appears that mukhtiar kaur s relations with her in laws had got strained and she had left her matrimonial home and come to live with ujjagar singh  her uncle  7 or 8 months earlier and the suggestion was that mukhtiar kaur had been killed by the appellant with his licensed gun and he had thereafter attempted to commit suicide   argument the learned counsel for the accused has raised several arguments in the course of hearing  he has pointed out that there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that mukhtiar kaur had been subjected to rape and in this view of the matter the very basis for the imposition of the death penalty was not made out  he has also pointed out that there were no eye witnesses to the incident and the 4 witnesses i e  jora singh and others who had reached the place of incident and carried the injured appellant to the hospital had also resiled and as the prosecution story now rested on circumstantial evidence alone  it was imperative for the investigating officer to have taken the finger prints from the weapon and that in any case the recovery of the spent cartridges and the gun were clearly suspicious as the weapon had been sent to the laboratory after an inordinate delay  it has also been submitted that in a case of attempted suicide a firearm must of necessity be used from a very close range and the absence of any blackening  charring or burning around the wound on ujjagar singh clearly ruled out the possibility of such an attempt  it has finally been submitted that the land had been transferred in the name of ujjagar singh s sons in the year 1994 by gurmail kaur  mother of mukhtiar kaur by a collusive decree and there was no evidence to show that mukhtiar kaur had ever displayed any unhappiness or made any complaint to any person or any authority with regard to the decree and as such  the very basis of the prosecution story did not exist  he had laid great emphasis on the fact that no reference to the gun or cartridges had been made in the inquest report and that in any case the weapon and the spent cartridges had been sent to the laboratory belatedly   issue convictions and sentences by the high court should be maintained or not   analysis from the medical evidence and from the chemical examiner s reports that the vaginal swab and clothes taken from the dead body did indicate the presence of semen  there is however absolutely no evidence to suggest  even assuming that the intercourse had been committed by the appellant  that he had done so without mukhtiar kaur s consent or against her will  it is also significant that the investigators had made no attempt whatsoever to have the appellant medically examined to ascertain his capacity to perform sexual intercourse  it must nonetheless be emphasized that whether a chain is complete or not would depend on the facts of each case emanating from the evidence and no universal yardstick should ever be attempted  it is in this background that we must examine the circumstances in the present case  a few facts stand out from the prosecution story  first  the place of incident being adjoining rooms in the residential house of the appellant and the fact that the alleged murder weapon is his licensed dbbl gun is proved on record  the evidence also reveals that the appellant was living in the premises along with his wife  mother and son  and two daughters  who were studying outside the village  were frequent visitors  but it is the admitted position that nobody but the appellant and the deceased were present at the time of incident  it is also clear from the evidence that the two spent cartridge cases recovered  one from near mukhtiar kaur s dead body  and the second from the right barrel of the gun lying near the appellant had been sent to the forensic science laboratory which opined that one of the cartridges had been fired from the gun and the other could have been fired therefrom  it is true that in a case relating to circumstantial evidence motive does assume great importance but to say that the absence of motive would dislodge the entire prosecution story is perhaps giving this one factor an importance which is not due and  to use the clichi  the motive is in the mind of the accused and can seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy  there is however a hint in the testimony of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh that his enquiries had revealed that the accused was having illicit relations with mukhtiar kaur and we can assume that some thing untoward had happened which could have triggered the volatile and hostile incident  there could perhaps be some truth in this suggestion  as it is significant that though the appellant had an extended family living with him i e  mother  wife  son living  in the village  and two young daughters who were studying outside and residing in a hostel  but were frequent visitors home  yet none of them has come forth to depose in his favour  therefore  this is yet another circumstance inculpating the accused  it is also significant that the shot had apparently travelled upwards skirting the mandible  through the flesh of the cheek in an upward direction with minimal damage to the bone structure and it is indeed providential that the appellant got away with only an injury  albeit a very serious one  the fact that the shot was fired from below going upwards is also supported by the site plan exh  pjj wherein marks of a shot hitting the roof were seen at point e whereas the appellant was found lying at point d in the same room  it is therefore apparent that the weapon had indeed been fired by the appellant from a close range and that the blackened portion around the wound had been removed by dr  sanjay uppal  it is true that it is generally for the prosecution to prove its case beyond doubt but in circumstances such as the present one  some explanation is also due from an accused in order to absolve himself from suspicion of the crime  no part of the evidence of the hostile witnesses comes to the aid of the appellant  the question now arises as to the sentence that should be imposed on the appellant  it would be seen that both the sessions court and the high

to for the sake of brevity as the said act is involved herein \\nthe factual matrix of the matter which is not much in dispute is as under \\nfirst respondent is the registered proprietor of a trade mark field marshal for diesel engines since 1964 bearing no 228867 one m s jain industries got the trade mark field marshal registered under clause 7inter alia for flour mills centrifugal pumps couplings for machines pulleys included in class 7 and valves parts of machines the said registration was renewed for the periods 13 5 1972 and 12 5 1979 13 5 1979 and 12 7 1986 and 13 7 1986 and 12 7 1993 appellant is said to have commenced its business of manufacturing and selling centrifugal pumps also under the mark field marshall \\nallegedly on the premise that the first respondent is the proprietor of the said mark by reason of long user and thus acquired a reputation in that behalf a legal notice was issued upon it questioning its right to use the said mark in respect of centrifugal pumps by the appellant laying a claim that it had been using the said mark since 1963 \\nrespondent no 1 thereafter filed a suit in the delhi high court for grant of a decree of permanent injunction being suit no 2408 of 1985 alleging infringement of the said mark andor claiming right of passing off in respect thereof \\nan ex parte order of injunction was passed on 19 12 1985 against the

suit m s \\njain industries by a deed of assignment assigned the said trade mark along with its goodwill in favour of the appellant \\none of the stipulations contained therein reads as under that the party of the second part has satisfied the party of the first part of having used the mark field marshal in respect of centrifugal pumps and valves since 1973 \\nindisputably first respondent filed an application under section 4656 and 107 of the act marked as c o no 9 of 1986contending that m s jain industries having not used the trade mark in respect of centrifugal pumps for a period more than five years and one month the mark should be taken off the register \\nit claimed user of the said mark since 1963 and sought for rectification of the register by expunging the expression circulation

thukral mechanical works railway road sirhind punjab are registered as subsequent proprietors of this mark as from 30th may1986 by virtue of agreement dated 30th may1986 and \\nthe registration of the aforesaid trade mark has been renewed from time to time and will remain in force for a period of a seven years from 13th \\nmay1986 and may be renewed at the expiration of that period and of each succeeding period of a seven years \\nin the said c o no 9 of 1986 filed by the first respondent against m s jain industries despite service of notice nobody appeared on behalf of the defendant 16 1 1987 was the date fixed in the said suit \\nappellant  s counsel appeared on that date and inter alia contended that presently it was the registered owner of the trade mark which was sought to be cancelled \\nin view of that statement a submission was made on behalf of the first respondent that it may be permitted to withdraw the petition with liberty to file a fresh petition on the same cause of action \\nthe learned judge directed recording of statements of the learned counsel in this behalf pursuant whereto the same were recorded which reads as under c o 9 of 1986 \\nmr singh has filed a reply in this petition bringing out that presently he is the registered owner of the trademark which is sought to be cancelled in this petition \\nin view of this situation learned counsel for the

thakural mechanical works bringing out there in that they are now the registered proprietors of said \\ntrade mark no 228867 in \\nthis view of the matter learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that he may be permitted to withdraw this petition with permission to file a fresh petition on this very cause of action \\nthe request is not opposed on behalf of m s thakural mechanical works \\nin these circumstances the request of the plaintiff is granted and petitioner is permitted to withdraw this petition and file a fresh petition on this very cause of action \\nthe petition is accordingly filed as withdrawn leaving the parties to bear their own costs \\na fresh application was filed by the first respondent \\nthe said m s jain industries however was not impleaded as a party therein \\nthe cause of action therefor was stated to have arisen in the following circumstances that the cause of action for the present petition arose in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents in the month of january 1987 when the respondent informed this honourable court that they have been recorded as subsequent proprietors of the impugned registered trade mark no 228867 in class 7 in c o no 9 of 1986whereupon the petitioner withdrew the said earlier petition c o no 9 of 1986 with permission of the court to file the present petition because of the changed circumstances \\nthe cause of action is continuous from day to day till the impugned registration is cancelled rectified \\nthe injunction matter in suit no 2408 of 1985 came up for hearing before a learned single judge of the high court \\nby an order dated 19 1 1988having regard to the provisions contained in the said act the learned judge opined that appellant having become the registered proprietor of the said trade mark no case for grant of injunction has been made out the interim order of injunction passed on 19 12 1985 was vacated and the defendants were permitted to use their registered trade mark subject to the following conditions a defendants will not use the logo style of the word field marshal of which logo and style the plaintiff is the proprietor under the copyright act \\nb defendants shall mention the name of the defendant firm thukral mechanical works sirhind on each and every centrifugal pump manufactured by them and sold in the name of field marshal \\nc the defendants shall maintain proper accounts of the sale of centrifugal pumps under the trade mark field marshal and shall file them in court as and when directed \\ncorrectness or otherwise of the said order has not been questioned \\nthe second rectification application filed by the first respondent however was transferred to the intellectual property appellate board \\nthe said application was dismissed \\na writ petition was filed there against by the first respondent \\na learned single judge of the delhi high court however refused to stay the operation of the order of the board dated 27 10 2004 an appeal was preferred there against \\nthe division bench of the high court thereafter while disposing of both the writ petition and the letters patent appeal allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of the board and directed it to adjudicate the dispute on merits \\nthe said order of the division bench is under challenge in this appeal \\nthe core question which arises for our consideration is as to whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case the application under s 461b was maintainable \\nbefore adverting thereto we may take notice of the relevant statutory provisions ss 461b481482 and 56 read as under section 46 removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non use  1 subject to the provisions of section 47a registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application made in the prescribed manner to a high court or to the registrar by any person aggrieved on the ground either a b that up to a date one month before the date of the application a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being provided that except where the applicant has been permitted under sub s 3 of s 12 to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of the goods in question or where the tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark the tribunal may refuse an application u cl a or cl b in relation to any goods if it is shown that there has been before the relevent date or during the relevant period as the case may be bona fide use of the trade mark by any proprietor thereof for the time being in relation to goods of the same description being goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered \\nsection 48 registered users  1 subject to the provisions of section 49a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as the registered user thereof in respect of any or all of the goods in respect of which the trademark is registered otherwise than as a defensive trade mark but the central government may by rules made in this behalf provide that no application for registration as such shall be enertained unless the agreement between the parties complies with the conditions laid down in the rules for preventing trafficking in trade marks \\nthe permitted use of a trade mark shall be deemed to be used by the proprietor thereof and shall be deemed not to be used by a person other than the proprietor for the purposes of s 46 or for any other purpose for which such use is material under this act or any other law \\nsection 56 power to cancel or vary registration and to rectify the register  1 \\non application made in the prescribed manner to a high court or to the registrar by any person aggrieved the tribunal may make such order as it may think fit for cancelling or varying the registration of a trade mark on the ground of any contravention or failure to observe a condition entered on the register in relation thereto \\nany person aggrieved by the absence or omission from the register of any entry or by any entry made in the register without sufficient cause or by any entry wrongly remaining on the register or by any error of defect in any entry in the register may apply in the prescribed manner to a high court or to the registrar and the tribunal may make such order for making expunging or varying the entry as it may think fit \\nthe tribunal may in any proceeding under this section decide any question that may be necessary or expedient to decide in connection with the rectification of the register \\nthe tribunal of its own motion may after giving notice in the prescribed manner to the parties concerned and after giving them an opportunity of being heard make any order referred to in sub s 1 or sub s 2 \\nany order of the high court rectifying the register shall direct that notice of the rectification shall be served upon the registrar in the prescribed manner who shall upon receipt of such notice rectify the register accordingly \\nthe power to rectify the register conferred by this section shall include the power to remove a trade mark registered in part a of the register to part b of the register \\nindisputably the scope of the provisions for removal from register in terms of s 46 and 56 of the act stand on different footings \\nwhereas s 46 had a limited application s 56 of the act is wider in nature \\nconcededly cl a of sub s 1 of s 46 is not attracted in the case \\nfor the purpose of appreciation of the rival contentions we may notice the findings of the board as also the high court \\nthe board has taken the view that the period of five years and one month will begin to run from the date on which thukral became the proprietor of the trademark that is30th may1986 and therefore the rectification application could have been filed by the appellant only sometime in 1991 opining that an application for rectification against the appellant within a period of seven and a half months from the date of assignment of the trade mark was not maintainable the application was dismissed \\nthe high court on the other hand opined it was not anybody  s case before us that m s jain industries \\nthe registered proprietor of the trademark used it at all \\nthe trademark was used by the appellant and thukral neither of whom were proprietors thereof except that thukral claims to have become its proprietor with effect from 30th may1986 according to learned counsel for the appellant the use of the trademark by thukral was not legally permissible use inasmuch as thukral did not have the consent tacit or otherwise of m s jain industries to use the trademark \\nif thukral did then it can not be said that there was no bona fide use thereof by its proprietor \\nthat is m s jain industries \\nthis appears to be the position at least till 30th may1986 in \\nthe meantime as a result of the ex parte ad interim injunction granted on 19th december 1985 by this court in suit no 2408 of 1985there was no question of thukral using the trademark field marshal till the injunction was vacated on 19th january1988 \\nthe act was enacted to provide for the registration and better protection of trademarks and for the prevention of the use of fraudulent marks of merchandise \\nregistration of a trade mark remains valid for seven years \\nrenewal applications are required to be filed on the expiry of seven years \\nm s jain industries got itself registered and obtained periodical renewal thereof as is required under the act \\nfirst respondent withdrew the application against m s jain industries \\nthe prayer in the application was to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps goods so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned \\nit is in the aforementioned situation we are called upon to determine the meaning of the words for the time being occurring in s 461b of the act \\ntwo interpretations thereto which are possible are 1 the said words would denote non use of the trade mark in relation to the goods by the appellant for a period of five years or longer and 2 the mark had not been used for a period of five years or longer either by the present proprietor thereof or his predecessor \\nwe may however also notice that another construction of the said provision has been put forth by mr sunderam learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that the word proprietor would not mean a registered proprietor but also a person who has become proprietor by long use thereof \\nthe words for the time being would mean differently in different situations \\nit may mean the moment or existing position as was held by this court in the case of jivendra nath kaul v collector district magistrate and anr 1992 \\n3 scc 576 1992 indlaw sc 1107 or in the context of cl 22 of art 366 of the constitution as has been held in h h maharajadhiraja \\nmadhav rao jivaji rao scindia bahadur of gwalior h h maharajadhiraja \\nmaharana shri bhagwat singhji bahadur of udaipur v union of india and anr air 1971 \\nsc 530 1970 indlaw sc 300 para 88 to mean by the use of the expression for the time being in cl 22 of art 366 \\nthe president is not invested with authority to accord a temporary recognition to a ruler nor with authority to recognize or not to recognize a ruler arbitrarily the expression for them time being predicts that there shall be a ruler of the indian state that if the first recognized ruler dies or ceases to be a ruler a successor shall be appointed and that there shall not be more rulers than one at a given time \\nthe terms also may bring within its umbrage the entire period of five years or more irrespective of the fact as to whether the registered proprietor was one or more than one as has been held by the high court \\nthere can not be any doubt or dispute that the registration of a trade mark confers a very valuable right \\nthe person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods as that of the registered owner \\nit confers an exclusive right of use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in which the trade mark is registered \\nthe same is an assignable right in terms of s 36 of the act whereas an unregistered trade mark is not \\nuser of the said mark therefore entails the consequences laid down under cl b of sub s 1 of s 46 \\nhowever such an application can be filed only by a person aggrieved \\nwhen the applicant before the board establishes the fact in regard to non user of the mark for a period of more than five years on the part of the registered owner the latter may show that his case falls within the purview of sub s 3 of s 46 \\nthe question which therefore arises is as to who can prove that he had the bona fide intention to use the trade mark on the date of application for registration \\nindisputably it would be the registered proprietor \\ns 46 is a penal provision \\nit provides for civil or evil consequences \\nit takes away the valuable right of a registered proprietor \\nit therefore can be taken away only when the conditions laid down therefor are satisfied \\nwhile we say so we are not oblivious of the fact that trafficking in trade mark is to be discouraged \\na registered proprietor of a trade mark should not be permitted to circumvent the law of user of the trade mark for a long time by assigning the same from time to time \\nbut then such a case has to be made out \\nallegation of trafficking is a serious one \\nit must be proved in presence of the person against whom such allegations are made \\nat the time of grant of original registration advertisements are issued and objections are called for \\nrenewal of registration in a sense also is not automatic \\na person who had been using the said trade mark as a proprietor thereof by user is supposed to keep itself abreast with such applications filed by another either for registration of the trade mark or renewal thereof \\nthe non user for a long time would disentitle a registered proprietor from renewal of the registration \\nit must not however be forgotten that s 461b provides for a special remedy \\nas a person obtains a right on and from the date of registration andor renewal thereof he can ordinarily be deprived of his right unless it is shown that the assignment thereof by his holder was not a bona fide one or had been made by way of camouflage \\nif the assignee has obtained assignment for bona fide use he may not be fastened with any liability owing to non user on the part of his predecessor \\nin other words the mistake of the predecessor should not be visited with non use of the present registered owner \\nit must however be observed that whether a use is for bona fide purpose would essentially be a question of fact \\nwhether s 461b read with s 48 of the act would bring within its purview not only a registered proprietor but also the proprietor who had otherwise acquired a right would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case \\nin kabushiki kaisha toshiba v tosiba appliances co ors 2008 8 scale 354 2008 indlaw sc 1395this court held we do not find any force in the aforementioned submission \\ncls a and b operate in different fileds \\nsub s 3 covers a case falling within cl b and not the cl a thereof \\nhad the intention of the parliament been that sub s 3 covers cases falling under cl b and clause ahaving regard to the similarity of the expressions used there was no reason as to why it could not be stated so explicitly \\nit was furthermore opined there may be a case where owing to certain special circumstances a continuous use is not possible \\nthe trade mark for which registration is obtained is used intermittently \\nsuch non user for a temporary period may be due to any exigency including a bar under a statute or a policy decision of the government or any action taken against the registrant \\nit was observed that in cases of intermittent use also cl b shall apply \\nin kabushiki kaisha toshiba this court relied upon hardie trading ltd anr \\nv addisons paint chemicals ltd 2003 11 scc 92 2003 indlaw sc 756 in our opinion the phrase person aggrieved for the purposes of removal on the ground of non use under s 46 has a different connotation from the phrase used in s 56 for canceling or expunging or varying an entry wrongly made or remaining in the register \\nthe submission of mr sudhir chandra \\nthat the appellant was an infringer both of the right of m s jain industries as also the first respondent and thus its use was not bona fide in a case of this nature can not be accepted \\nif appellant infringed the right of m s jain industries it was for it to take action there for \\nit did not \\nfirst respondent itself accepts that at least immediately prior to the institution of the suit appellant had been using the same \\nwe are not concerned herein as to since when it had been doing so \\nit obtained an or of injunction \\nthe order of injunction was vacated \\nfor one reason or the other the said order attained finality \\nprima facie therefore appellant has been held to be the registered owner of the trade mark \\nit is one thing to say that for the purpose of frustrating an application for rectification the appellant had colluded with its predecessor for the purpose of trafficking by entering into the deed of assignment which is otherwise illegal and bad in law \\nbut it is another thing to say that the appellant could be proceeded against alone for non user of the registered trade mark for a period of more than five years \\nfor the purpose of making out such a case both the original registrants as also the assignee were required to be impleaded as parties \\nwe may at this stage notice that in law of trade marks by mr k c kailasam while commenting on s 47 of the trade marks act1999 to which our attention has been drawn by mr sudhir chandra it is stated \\nnotes on clauses \\nthis clause corresponds to s 46 of the existing act and provides for removal of a trade mark from the register on the ground of non use \\na trade mark which is not used within five years of its registration becomes liable for removal either completely or in respect of those goods or services for which the mark has not been used \\nunder s 461it is proposed to clarify that the five years period will start from the date on which the trade mark is actually entered on the register \\nthis amendment is intended to remove any ambiguity as for all other purposes the date of registration will be the date on which the application was filed vide cl 232 proviso to sub cl 1 also provides that the tribunal may refuse removal of the mark if it is shown that any proprietor had in fact made bona fide use of the trademark for goods or services of the same description or associated goods or services \\nit is also proposed to increase the period from 1 to 3 months in cl 471a and b in which use of the trade mark prior to the date of filing of the application for removal of the trade mark shall be disregarded \\nthis is intended to prevent the registered proprietor to by pass the act by such token use after he comes to know that an application for removal is about to be filed sub cl 3 protects a mark from being removed from the register on ground of non use if such non use is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade \\nthe clause is proposed to be modified to clarify that special circumstances in the trade will include restrictions imposed by any law or regulation on the use of trade mark in india \\nconsequential amendments have been made to cover services cl 47 of the bill \\nthe court while construing a statute takes into consideration the parliamentary intent in amending the provisions thereof \\nit seeks to enhance the period of moratorium of use of the registered trade mark from one month to three months so as to prevent speculative assignment \\nthus a case of speculative assignment is specifically required to be made out \\nsuch an application may be maintainable in terms of s 56 of the act but strictly not in terms of s 461b thereof and that too in the absence of the original registered proprietor \\nwe are not satisfied with the explanation offered by the first respondent that it gave up the case of non use of the registered trade mark against m s jain industries on the basis of statement made by the learned counsel for the appellant firstly because consent does not confer jurisdiction secondly because want andor lack of jurisdiction on the part of the tribunal can not be waived as if any order is passed without jurisdiction the same would be a nullity and thirdly because the cause of action even according to the first respondent in his application before the high court was different \\nthe counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant did not state that it had waived its right so far as non impleadment of m s jain industries was concerned \\nit only consented for grant of liberty in favour of the first respondent for filing of an application for the self same cause of action \\nthe question of maintainability of the second suit is absence of the registrant proprietor was not and could not have been the subject matter of consent at that stage \\nthe cause of action which permitted the first respondent to file an application for rectification against m s jain industries was non user thereof by it \\nits non user and rectification of the register could not in the aforementioned situation have been tagged with the cause of action if any against the appellant \\nthe second contention of mr that the appellant was an infringer of the trade mark is again a question of fact \\nthe right of the first respondent as a proprietor of the trade mark by reason of a long user is required to be determined vis  vis m s jain industries as also the appellant in the suit filed by it which is pending \\nthe board could not while exercising its jurisdiction under s 461bof the act proceeded on the basis of such presumption \\nit is not correct that no cause of action survived against jain industries \\nit was not lost by reason of assignment as was contended by the learned counsel \\nin the suit only the competing right of the first respondent qua the appellant can be determined and not a right against m s such a right can not be determined in a proceeding under s 461b of the act which is restricted to non user of the registered trade mark \\nboth the appellant and the respondent no 1 were the infringers of the right of m s jain industries as it was the registered proprietor of the trade mark in respect of the goods in question namely centrifugal pumps \\ntwo interpretations of the said provision s 461b are possible \\nwhile interpreting the same however certain basic principles of construction of statute must be kept in mind \\nas it takes away somebody  s right it deserves strict construction \\njurisdiction of the board being dependent on determination of the foundational facts the same was required to be established on the basis of the averments made in the application and not otherwise \\nthe right of a registered trade mark is not lost automatically on the expiry of five years and one month \\nit does not provide for a sun set law \\nit has to be adjudicated upon \\nwhether the registered proprietor of the trade mark had taken recourse to trafficking or not must be determined in an appropriate proceeding \\nthe principle of purchaser of a property has a duty to make enquiriestherefore cannot apply in a case of this nature \\nso long as the right to assign a registered trade mark remains valid once the same is validly assigned the assignee derives the same right as that of the assignor in terms of the statute \\na title to a trade mark derived on assignment as provided for under the act can not be equated with a defective title acquired in any other property as admittedly on the date of assignment the right of the registered trade mark was not extinguished \\nboth the findings of the high court which we have noticed hereinbefore are findings on question of law and in that view of the matter the contention of mr sudhir chandra that the merit of the matter is yet to be gone into by the board can not be a ground for ignoring the submissions made at the bar \\nour attention has again been drawn to a passage from law of trade marks geographical indications by shri k c kailasam wherein the judgment of the tribunal has been criticized in the following terms from the above legislative intent it would seem that the period of non use of the trade mark is to be reckoned continuously from the date of its registration \\nin the case of american home products corporation v mac laboratories pvt ltd \\nrendered under the 1958 act it was held by the supreme court that the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the register has only to prove \\nsuch continuous non user \\nit would appear that neither the u k act nor the indian act at any time envisaged that the commencement of 5 year period of non use is to be delinked from the date of registration of the mark so as to give a fresh lease of life to the registration every time there is change in the ownership of the mark \\nif that be so any registered proprietor could easily defeat an application for rectification by assigning the mark to some other person to have a fresh period of 5 years from the date of assignment and thus effectively frustrate the very object of the provision in s 471a and b further it is to be noted that an assignment is subject to the provisions of the act and any rights vested in any other person see \\ns 37 the assignor can not obviously transfer more rights than he himself has to the assignee under the act \\nwe do not think that the approach of the learned author is entirely correct \\nan assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses \\nif his title is not extinguished by reason of a provision of a statute for non user of the trade mark for a period of five years any assignment made shall be valid subject to such situation which we have noticed in paragraph 25 supra \\nfor the views we have taken we are of the opinion that the impugned judgment can not be sustained \\nit is set aside accordingly \\nthe board shall however proceed to determine afresh the application filed by the first in the light of the legal principles explained above \\nthe appeal is allowed with costs \\ncounsel  s fee assessed at rs 100000 \\nappeal allowed \\n\",\n          \"this appeal by special leave has been preferred by tata consultancy engineers against an award dated 20th december1978 of the industrial tribunal maharashtra bombay revising the wage scales of certain categories of employees and granting various other benefits \\ntata consultant engineers at its inception was a partnership firm but subsequently the partnership was dissolved and in 1974 the undertaking became one of the divisions of tata sons limited \\nit functions as a consulting organisation and a service industry and does not manufacture any product or carry on trade \\nits work force consists of engineers and supervisors and different categories of workmen \\nout of 665 employees at bombay the draftsmen and the administrative staff number 306 these workmen are members of the tata consultant employees union \\nthey served a charter of demands in july1974on the appellant and as their demands were not accepted and conciliation proceedings proved fruitless the state government made a reference of the dispute under s 101 dindustrial tribunal maharashtra for adjudication \\nthe reference was numbered i t no 292 of 1975 \\nthe union filed a statement before the tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments \\nit was urged that the efficiency bar as a feature of the wage scales should be removed \\nthe dearness allowance it was claimed should be granted on a slab system \\nthe claim of the union was resisted by the appellant who maintained that the existing wage scales were fair and reasonable on a region cum industry basis and that it would not be possible for the appellant to bear the additional financial burden if the demands of the union were accepted \\nreference was made to the political uncertainty in iran which had placed an appreciable part of the appellant  s business in jeopardy and to various other factors peculiar to an engineering consultancy business beyond the appellant  s control \\nthere was fierce competition also it was asserted from other similar organisations \\nthe appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised \\nthere was no separate dearness allowance until january1977 when it was introduced for the first time \\nhouse rent allowance was also paid \\ndearness allowance became payable at 10 of the basic wage subject to a minimum of rs 50 and house rent allowance at 30 of the basic salary \\nnothing those facts the tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years there was definite need for revising the wage scales \\nit was pointed out that the dearness allowance and house rent allowance granted by the appellant made little impact in neutralising the cost of living \\nthe need for revising the wage scales was not disputed by the appellant \\nin proceeding to revise the wage structure the tribunal took into account the two principles involved in the process the financial capacity of the industry to bear the burden of an increased wage bill and the prevailing wage structure on an industry cum region basis \\nwage scale statements were filed by the parties before the tribunal pertaining to several engineering consultancy organisations but \\nin the absence of pertinent information concerning the strength of their labour force the extent of their business the financial position for some years the capital invested the precise nature of the business the position regarding reserves dividends declared and future prospects of the company the tribunal found that it was unable to rely on them as comparable concerns \\nholding it impossible in the circumstances to apply the principle of industry cum region basis the tribunal turned to a consideration of the financial capacity of the company to bear an additional burden in this connection it proceeded on the footing that the appellant was a separate and independent division of tata sons limited and had no functional integrality with the other divisions \\nhaving regard to the net profits earned by the appellant from 1968 to 1977 it found that the acceptance of the demands of the union would result in an increased burden of rs 7 crores a burden which would dry up the appellant  s resources and would be impossible for it to bear \\nthe union modified its demands but even the modified terms according to the tribunal appeared to be on the high side inasmuch as the resulting total burden of rs 1 70 crores was much higher than the average profits could sustain \\nthe particular character of the appellant that it was a service industry and not a manufacturing concern was taken into account and it was observed that unlike a manufacturing business there was little scope for diversification in the case of an engineering consultancy \\nnonetheless the tribunal observed there was every reason to expect that the appellant would be able to earn sound profits in the future and the instability in its business activities occasioned by the turbulent political situation in iran would be it was expected compensated by contracts secured in different developing countries \\nfor the purpose of determining the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal followed unichem laboratories v their workmen 1972 indlaw sc 181 where it was held that the gross profits should be computed without making deductions on account of taxation development rebate and depreciation \\nit decided also that there was no ground for deducting the notional value of gratuity \\nrevising the figures on that basis it computed the annual gross profits for the years 1968 to 1977 and determined the annual average at rs 26 69 lakhs \\nthe tribunal took note of the elaborate scales of wages already existing in the wage structure of the appellant and decided to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category \\nit also observed that the category of draughtsmen needed a special increase \\nbut it rejected the demand of the union for dearness allowance on the basis of a slab system because that would have imposed an unacceptable burden on the appellant  s financial capacity and there was no reason why the existing scheme of dearness allowance should be disturbed when a substantial increase was being made in the level of the basic wage \\ntaking into account the circumstance that besides the staff of 306 workmen represented by the union there were several other employees who would also have to be paid the tribunal considered it fair in paragraph 23 of the award to give a flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories \\nit rejected the demand of the union for abolishing the efficiency bar but the span of 15 years for earning increment was expanded in some grades to 20 years and some adjustments were also made in specific grades \\nthe tribunal also noted that after the salaries of the employees had been fixed in the respective scales senior employees would have to be given some more increments in the new scales according to their completed years of service \\ntaking all these factors into consideration it made an award dated 20th december1978 prescribing the following revision in the existing scales of wages \\nthe tribunal maintained the existing schemes of dearness allowance and house rent allowance and observed that in view of the revised basic wages there would be a resultant increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance \\nthe revised wage scales the tribunal directed should take effect retrospectively from 1st january1976 it also laid down the principle enabling the actual fitment of the workmen in their respective wage scales as on that date and also provided for the number of increments to which they would be entitled having regard to the period of completed service \\ntwo days after the award was made an application was made by the union stating in the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance \\nfurther it appears that the tribunal intended to grant the increase of rs 150 to each draughtsman and rs 100 to all other workmen in their basic pay \\nhowever this is not clearly mentioned anywhere in the award due to accidental slip or omission \\nthe union prayed that the position may be clarified and the award corrected accordingly \\non the same date the tribunal disposed of the application by the following order there can be no doubt that a flat increase of rs 150 to each of the employees in the category of draftsmen and of rs 100 to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award \\nthe same has been made clear in paragraph \\nno 23but it appears that the words to each employee after the figure rs 150 were omitted \\nsimilarly the same words to each employee after the figure 100 were omitted \\nwhen the award is sent for publication a necessary corrigendum be made in the award and the aforesaid words after the figures rs 150 and rs 100 be added \\nit may be mentioned that only from that point of view viz to grant flat increase of rs 150 and of rs 100 to the employees in the category of draftsmen and the other categories respectively that a burden statement was called for from the company and the same was submitted vide exhibit c 51 the fitment has also to be done only after the flat increase is added to the present basic salary of each employee \\ni do not think that any problem would arise for interpretation of the award \\nsince the award has been already signed i do not think anything further can be added to this award \\nsd k n wani industrial tribunal \\nin this appeal the learned counsel for the appellant had covered a wide field but in the end he states that the appellant is aggrieved by two matters only \\none is the retrospectivity attached to the revised wage scales and the other is the flat increase given to each employee of rs 150 in the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in other categories resulting from the order dated 22nd december1978 \\nthe workmen have filed an appeal by special leave civil appeal no 2300 of 1979in which they have challenged the rejection by the tribunal of their claim in respect of dearness allowance which they contend should be pegged to the cost of living index and should not be a fixed amount \\nconsidering the appeal of tata consulting engineers first the contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal erred in making the wage scales retrospective and in any event in ranging the retrospectivity back to 1st january1976 \\nwe have been taken through some of the material on the record in the attempt to support the contention but after giving careful thought to the matter i think there is ample justification for what the tribunal did \\nit must be remembered that although the wage scales were introduced as long ago as 1973 they were maintained at that level except for a slight revision some time thereafter \\nno dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time \\nthe cost of living had gone on increasing from 1972 onwards and as the tribunal has found the dearness allowance and house rent allowance made no appreciable impact in neutralising the increasing cost \\nduring all these years the appellant had continued to enjoy increasing profits nonetheless the emoluments received by the workmen did not receive the impress of the appellant  s growing prosperity \\nthe charter of demands was presented by the union in july1974 and when conciliation proceedings failed the state government made the reference to the industrial tribunal in 1975 the tribunal has referred to various considerations which prevailed with it in giving retrospectivity to the revised pay scales \\nthey are considerations which can not be ignored \\naccordingly the contention raised on behalf of the appellant against retrospectivity of the wage scales must be rejected \\nthe challenge embodied in the second contention against the amendment of the award is more serious \\nit is urged that the amendment results in the inclusion of a flat increase of rs 150 to each workman in the case of draughtsman and rs 100 to each workman in the case of other categories a result wholly unwarranted it is said by the intent of the original award and therefore falling beyond the jurisdiction of the tribunal \\nin making the application of 22nd \\ndecember1978the union invoked the jurisdiction of the \\ntribunal under rule 31 of the industrial disputes bombay rules1957 rule 31 provides the labour court tribunal or arbitrator may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any award it or he issues \\nthe jurisdiction given to the tribunal by rule 31 is closely circumscribed \\nit is only a clerical mistake or error which can be corrected and the clerical mistake or error must arise from an accidental slip or omission in the award \\nan accidental slip or omission implies that something was intended and contrary to that intention what should not have been included has been included or what should have been included has been omitted \\nit must be a mistake or error amenable to clerical correction only \\nit must not be a mistake or error which calls for rectification by modification of the conscious adjudication on the issues involved \\nis the instant case one where the amendment made by the tribunal in the original award can be said to correct a mere clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission \\nto answer the question it is necessary to examine the basis of the award and the intent which flows from that basis \\nthe terms of reference in the state government  s order required the tribunal to revise the scales of pay and dearness allowance and there was no mention of giving any ad hoc increase in the basic pay of individual workman \\nit would do well to recall that the claim of the union filed before the tribunal also centered on the need to revise the wage scales \\nthat was the main issue between the parties \\nit is to the task of revising the pay scales that the tribunal addressed itself and throughout the material part of the award it is that task which held its focussed attention \\nthe financial capacity of the appellant and the related study of its annual profits from 1968 to 1977were examined from that view point \\nthe sufficiency of the existing pay scales was considered in detail and regard was had to their original structure and the accretions made subsequently by way of dearness allowance and house rent allowance \\nfor the purpose of restructuring the pay scales the tribunal ruled on the paying capacity of the appellant both with reference to the profits of the preceding year as well as the prospects of the future \\nthe financial capacity as the tribunal observed constituted one of the principles which are required to be followed in the fixation of the wage structure \\na clear statement of its intention is found in paragraph 22 of the award where the tribunal stated i only propose to modify the existing structures of the scales with flat increases in each category \\nno ad hoc increase to the pay of each individual workman was intended \\nand that is confirmed by what was stated in paragraph 23 of the award considering this outgoing the flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draughtsman and rs 100 in the case of the other categories would be fair \\nit will be noted that the pay scales of different categories were being restructured and the flat increase envisaged there related to an increase in the general pay scales of different categories \\nindividual workmen were not present to the mind of the tribunal \\nthat the increase was pertinent to the general pay scales in the revised wage structure is patently clear from a comparison of the existing pay scales and the revised pay scales \\nthe comparative table of existing pay scales and the revised pay scales has been reproduced earlier \\nthe revised pay scales of all categories except the category of draughtsmen shows an increase of rs 100 in the initial pay fixed in each scale the increase in the case of the category of draughtsmen being rs 150  there was only one increase contemplated in the award in paragraph 23 of award and it is more than plain that the increase was the one incorporated in the revised pay scales pertaining to different categories \\nno second flat increase was envisaged at all \\nthe amendment made by the tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase this time to each individual workmen \\nif as the tribunal has stated in the amendment order the increase in paragraph 23 was intended to apply to each individual workmen there is nothing in the body of the award to form the foundation on which the actual figures in the restructured pay scales can be made to rest \\nthere will be no explanation why the initial start of the revised pay scales has been increased by rs 150 in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories \\nconsidering the fitment of the workman in the revised scales it was stated in the award that a workman found drawing a salary less than the beginning of the grade would be stepped up to the beginning of the grade and if his pay fell between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay was to be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale \\nconspicuous by its absence is any reference to a flat increase in the pay of an individual workmen \\neven when considering the range of permissible retrospectivity the tribunal stated in the award in view of the revision of the wage scales there would be consequent increase in the dearness allowance and the house rent allowance \\nand the clinching circumstances of all is that the award was made on the basis that the overall financial load according to paragraph 33 of the award would be to the tune of about rs 5 lakhs \\nit was that figure which the tribunal had in mind against the backdrop of the gross annual figures when it made the revised pay scales retrospective from 1st \\njanuary1976 this liability taken with the liability accruing on the need to increase the salaries of the other staff determined the tribunal  s deliberations in regard to the several features of the award including the grant of increments related to completed periods of service the expansion of the span from 15 years to 20 years for earning increments and other benefits \\nit can not be the case of the union that the figure of rs 5 lakhs mentioned in paragraph 33 of the award represented the result of adding a flat increase to the pay of each workman in addition to the benefits conferred by the revised pay scales and other awarded reliefs \\nin its order of 22nd \\ndecember1978the tribunal has referred to the statement exhibit c 51 filed by the appellant when called upon to indicate the increased financial burden apprehended by it \\nthe tribunal has relied on this statement as evidence showing that the appellant knew that a flat increase of rs 150 and rs 100 was intended to each of the employees in the category of draughtsmen and the other categories \\nin so construing the statement exhibit c 51the tribunal has grievously erred \\nit seems from a perusal of the document exhibit c 51that it is a statement giving trial figures of the increased financial load on different bases \\non the basis that a sum of rs 150 per month was added to the pay of each draughtsman and a sum of rs 100 was added to the pay of every other workman who belonged to the union staff the financial load would increase to rs 922032  likewise if a flat increase of rs 100 was given to individual workmen of all categories including draughtsmen the increased financial load would total rs 764256  the statement then goes on to indicate that if a flat increase of rs 75 per month were given to individual workmen of all categories the total increase would be rs 578220  again if the flat increase is rs 65 per month to the individual workmen of all categories the additional load would total rs 497772  finally on the basis that the individual draughtsman would be given an increase of rs 75 per month and the individual workmen of other categories rs 50 per month the additional load was calculated at rs 463092  it will be noted that the statement exhibit c 51was prepared on the basis of the employees strength as in december1971 a similar statement was prepared on the basis of the employees strength as in september1978 these statements can not be regarded as evidence that the appellant was cognizant of the intention of the tribunal to provide a flat increase to the pay of each workman \\nthe statement afforded an indication merely of what the additional financial load would be if a flat increase was given to the individual workman on the alternative basis set forth therein \\nnone of the alternatives was actually adopted by the tribunal because when the award was made the tribunal proceeded instead to restructure the wage scales by the addition of rs 150 in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100 in the case of other categories to the initial pay in the wage scales pertaining to those categories \\nthe addition was integrated as a feature of the wage scales it was not regarded as an addition to the pay of each individual workman \\nit seems that the tribunal was betrayed by a curious confusion in accepting the plea of the union that a flat increase to the pay of each workman was intended in the original wage and consequently it fell into the error of amending the award \\nthe evidence contained in the award throughout provides incontrovertible proof that this flat increase was never originally intended in the award \\nthe amendment has resulted in the tribunal making as it were a supplementary award whereby a further relief is being granted beyond that granted in the original award \\nthe original award was completed and signed by the tribunal and it can not be reopened now except for the limited purpose of rule 31 in travelling outside and beyond the terms of the original award the tribunal has committed a jurisdictional error \\nour attention has been drawn to what purports to be an endorsement by counsel for the appellant on the application dated 22nd december1978 filed by the union before the tribunal to the effect that the appellant would submit to whatever the tribunal decided and it is urged that the appellant is bound by the order made on the application \\nit is an accepted principle that consent by a party can not confer jurisdiction on a court \\nwhat is without jurisdiction will remain so \\nin the circumstances the order of 22nd december1978 is invalid so far as it amends paragraph 23 of the original award \\nthe corrigendum amending the award in consequence is liable to be quashed \\nthe second contention of the appellant is entitled to succeed \\ni shall now consider civil appeal no 2300 of 1979 filed by the workmen \\nthe only contention of the workmen is that the tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index \\nit is wrong in principle it is said to provide a fixed dearness allowance \\nreliance was placed on the hindustan times ltd new delhi v their workmen 1964 1 scr 234 1962 indlaw sc 436247 where it was observed by this court that dearness allowance should not remain fixed at any figure but should be on a sliding scale in order to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living \\nreference was also made to bengal chemical pharmaceutical works limited v its workmen \\n2 scr 113 1968 indlaw sc 183 now it is not a universal rule that the dearness allowance should in all cases be correlated with the cost of living index \\nthe tribunal in the present case considered the matter and found it sufficient and in accord with justice that the wage scales should be restructured with suitable increments provided therein \\nit noted that dearness allowance was being granted by the appellant at 10 of the salary subject to a minimum of rs 50 and house rent allowance at 30 of the basic salary \\nhaving regard to the not inconsiderable improvement in the level of the basic wage it observed that there would be a consequent increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance \\nin view of the increase so secured the tribunal rejected the suggestion that a slab system should be introduced in the dearness allowance or that there should be any other modification of the principle on which dearness allowance was being presently granted \\nit declared that the cumulative effect of an improved wage structure together with dearness allowance operating on a slab system would throw an impossible burden of about rs 1 crore on the financial capacity of the appellant \\nit was open to the tribunal to adopt the position which it did \\nif the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered \\nthe award is a composite document in which the several elements of increased wage scales larger increments longer span of 20 years for earning increments dearness allowance at 10 of the basic wage besides several other benefits have been integrated into a balanced arrangement in keeping with what the tribunal has found to be the financial capacity of the appellant \\nit is not possible to maintain one part of the award and supersede another \\naccordingly the appeal filed by the workmen must fail \\nin the result civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 is allowed in part insofar that the order dated 22nd december1978 of the industrial tribunal maharashtra bombay is quashed to the extent that it modifies the original award dated 20th december1978and the corrigendum made consequent thereto is also quashed \\ncivil appeal no 2300 of 1979 is dismissed \\nthere is no order as to costs \\nchinnappa reddy j we have had the advantage of perusing the judgment prepared by our learned brother pathak j we agree with him that civil appeal no 2300 of 1979 should be dismissed \\nwe also agree with him that civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 should also be dismissed in so far as it relates to the award dated december 201978 however we do not agree with our learned brother that civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 should be allowed in so far as it relates to the order dated december 221978 of the industrial tribunal which purports to correct the award dated december 201978 in our opinion civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 should be dismissed in its entirety \\nwe do not propose to give our reasons to the extent we are in agreement with pathak j and we propose to state our reasons for the disagreement only \\nit is needless to recapitulate all the basic facts which have been set out in the judgment of pathak j the award of the industrial tribunal was made on december 201978 on december 221978 that is to say two days after the award was made and when everything must have been fresh to the minds of the tribunal the respective parties and their advocates the employees union made an application under rule 31 of the industrial disputes bombay rules1957 seeking a correction of an error which it was claimed had crept into the award \\nthe application was as follows in the above reference your honour was pleased to pass an award on 20th december1978 \\nin the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance \\nfurther it appears that the tribunal intended to grant the increase of rs 150 to each draughtsman and rs 100 to all other workmen in their basic pay \\nthe union therefore prays the honourable tribunal to clarify the position and correct the award accordingly \\non this application the advocate for the employer company made the following endorsement submitted to whatever this honourable tribunal desires to do \\nthereafter the tribunal made an order on the same day in the following terms there can be no doubt that a flat increase of rs 150 to each of the employees in the category of draftsmen and of rs 100 to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award \\nthis order was made in the presence of shri manak gagrat advocate for the company and shri n p mehta advocate for the workmen \\nthe endorsement made on the application by the advocate for the company does not indicate that the company had any objection to the award being corrected as sought by the employees union \\non the other hand the endorsement reads as if there was tacit agreement on the part of the company to the correction sought by the union \\nthe order dated december 221978 of the tribunal also does not reveal that there was any opposition by the company to the application for correcting the award \\neven so we propose to examine whether the correction sought by the employees union was within the bounds of the authority of the tribunal or whether it was in effect a fresh award \\nthe primary and basic question considered by the industrial tribunal in making the award dated december 201978 was the question of revision of the wage scales \\nimplicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage scales and flat or ad hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary \\nit can not possibly be doubted that an industrial tribunal deciding upon the wage scales of the employees of an establishment would have full liberty to propose ad hoc increase of salaries as part of the revision of wages \\nnor can it be doubted that fitment into the revised pay scales is certainly a part of the revision of pay scales \\nthis in our opinion is elementary and fundamental to the jurisdiction of the industrial tribunal in revising wage scales \\nin the present case the industrial tribunal on a consideration of the material placed before it came to the conclusion that the company was in an undoubted position to bear the additional financial burden \\nat the end of paragraph 15 of the award the tribunal stated but there can be no doubt that the company can very well bear the additional burden \\nthe question is what should be the extent of such burden \\nat the end of paragraph 18 of the award the tribunal said a mere reading of exhibit u 15 will immediately dispel the misgivings about the future of the present company \\nfor some years to come this is likely to be one of the few consulting engineers who will be securing major contracts \\nagain in paragraph 19 it was said i have no doubt that the present company would be able to bear the additional burden for the years to come \\nthis is further borne out from the trading results of the company for the year 1968 69 to 1977 the profits have increased all along \\nthe copy of the letter dated july 231973alongwith \\nthe annexures from the company to the director general posts telegraphs delhi ex \\nc 27 indicates the important projects the company was handling in india and abroad and the amount of foreign exchange earned and repatriated \\ni will therefore proceed on the ground that the present company can bear the additional financial burden \\nfinally at the end of paragraph 21 \\nthe tribunal said in view of this position the company can easily bear some burden that might fall as a result of the upward revision of the wage scales \\nthe question is to what extent the relief should be given to the employees \\nafter expressing himself in categoric terms about the capacity of the company to bear the additional financial burden the tribunal went on to say i only propose to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category \\nthe tribunal then considered the question whether draftsmen should get a higher flat increase and the question whether the existing scheme of dearness allowance should be revised \\nthe tribunal then observed the flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draftsmen and rs 100 in the case of the other categories would be fair \\nthereafter various other matters were considered and finally the tribunal revised the wage scales in the manner already mentioned by my brother pathak j the question of fitment was then considered in the following manner fitment if as on 1st january1976an employee is drawing a salary less than the beginning of the respective grade he should be first stepped up to the beginning of the grade \\nif the pay of an employee does not coincide with any step in the revised pay scale and falls between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay of that employee shall be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale \\nafter fixing the salary of the employees in the scales as above the employees should be given increments in the new scales as noted below i employees who have completed 5 years or more as on 1st january19763 increments \\nii employees who have completed 4 years of service as on 1st january19762 increments \\nall other employees with more than one year  s service shall be given one increment \\nnow if without any flat or ad hoc increase of salary the workmen were to be fitted into the revised scales of pay it would obviously result in serious anomalous situations \\nin the case of several senior employees the revised scale would yield but a very small and almost a token increase in the size of the pay packet whereas the junior employees would get a large benefit \\nwhile workmen raising industrial disputes for revision of wage scales are certainly minded about their future prospects in the matter of wages they surely would be more concerned with the immediate benefits according to them \\nthat was why the industrial tribunal thought that an all round flat increase of rs 150 in the case of draftsmen and rs 100 in the case of other workmen was called for \\nit was clearly so intended by the tribunal as is evident from the reference to flat increase of rs 150 in the category of draftsmen and rs 100 in the case of the other categories \\nsince there was to be a flat increase of rs 150 and rs 100 in the case of draftsmen and other workmen respectively the revised wage scale had necessarily to commence with figures rs 150 and rs 100 above the existing wage scales \\nimmediately after the award was pronounced while the iron was still hot as it were the employees apparently realised that the employer might take advantage of the circumstance that it was not clearly mentioned in the award that all the employees were to get additional pay of rs 150 and rs 100 respectively and might contend that the tribunal had only revised the wage scales by increasing the salary on entry into the service and restructuring the scale of pay and never granted any ad hoc increase of salary to all employees \\ntherefore they filed an application before the tribunal for correcting the award so as to bring out what was intended \\nas it has now turned out what the employees apparently suspected the employer might contend is precisely what the employer is not contending though the employer did not choose to so contend before the industrial tribunal itself when the employees filed the application for rectification \\nthe application before the tribunal was filed under rule 31 of the bombay industrial disputes rules 1957which is as follows \\na board court labour court tribunal or arbitrator may at any time suo moto or on an application made by any of the parties concerned may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any proceedings report award or as the case may be decision \\nthe omission of the words to each employee first after the figure rs 150 and again after the figure rs 100 was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the tribunal was entitled to correct \\nwe are unable to see how it can be held to be otherwise \\nwe are not impressed with the submission of the learned counsel for the company that the corrigendum was in effect a fresh award \\nwe therefore see no ground for quashing the order dated december 221978 of the tribunal \\nthe result of the foregoing discussion is that civil appeal no 2299 of 1979 has to be dismissed in its entirety \\nwe have already indicated that we agree with our brother pathak j that the appeal civil appeal no 2300 of 1979 filed by the workmen should also be dismissed \\nwhile we find lot of force in the submission of shri v m tarkunde learned counsel for the workmen that dearness allowance linked to cost of living index is ordinarily the best and the most scientific method of computing dearness allowance it can not always be said that an illegality warranting interference under article 136 is committed if some other method is adopted \\nthe tribunal has given satisfactory reason for adopting a different mode and we are not disposed to interfere with the award of the tribunal \\nin the result both the appeals are dismissed without any order as to costs \\nthe order of the court was as follows \\nin view of the opinion of the majority both the appeals are dismissed and there is no order as to costs \\n\",\n          \"ujjagar singh the appellant herein a resident of village bangawali tehsil malerkotla was tried and convicted by the additional sessions judge sangrur for the murder of his niece mukhtiar kaur and was awarded the death penalty \\nin addition he was convicted for an offence punishable section 376 of the ipc and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to a fine of rs 5 000 and in default of payment to undergo further r i for one year and section 309 of the ipc to a sentence of simple imprisonment for one year \\nthe aforesaid convictions and sentences have been maintained by the high court and the matter is before us in these proceedings by way of special leave \\nthe facts of the case are as under \\nat about 2 00 p m on 10th november 2002 a boy whose identity is not forthcoming informed satnam singh pw2 that an incident of firing had taken place in the house of ujjagar singh situated in the fields on the outskirts of the village \\nsatnam singh conveyed this information to sarpanch jora singh pw1 who was attending a marriage at that time \\njora singh accompanied by gurdeep singh pw3 thereupon rushed to ujjagar singh  s house and found mukhtiar kaur lying dead with a gun shot injury and the appellant also with a gun shot injury lying unconscious on the ground in the adjoining room \\njora singh and gurdeep singh immediately removed ujjagar singh to the civil hospital dhuri in the jeep belonging to kulwant singh pw4 \\njora singh also met inspector harjinder pal singh pw14 at 4 40 p m near the hospital who recorded his statement at that place and with his endorsement exhibit p a sent it to police station dhuri where the formal fir was registered at about 4 45 p m with the special report being delivered to the illaka magistrate at dhuri itself at 6 20 p m the same evening \\nthe facts as narrated were that arjan singh of village bangawali had three sons puran singh ujjagar singh appellant and ajmer singh \\npuran singh had died about 20 years earlier leaving behind his wife two sons and a daughter mukhtiar kaur \\nthe two sons and the wife also died long before the incident and mukhtiar kaur the sole surviving member of this branch of the family had been married to balwinder singh pw9 about 9 or 10 years earlier \\npuran singh had however transferred 30 or 35 bighas of agricultural land falling to his share after the death of his father in the name of the appellant  s sons by a collusive decree in the year 1994 and the suggestion was that this transaction had been objected to by mukhtiar kaur who was demanding that the land be returned to her \\nit appears that mukhtiar kaur  s relations with her in laws had got strained and she had left her matrimonial home and come to live with ujjagar singh her uncle 7 or 8 months earlier and the suggestion was that mukhtiar kaur had been killed by the appellant with his licensed gun and he had thereafter attempted to commit suicide \\nhaving recorded the aforesaid facts in the fir pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh reached the place of incident and lifted one spent 12 bore cartridge case shaktiman make from near mukhtiar kaur  s dead body and one dbbl gun from the place where ujjagar singh appeared to have been shot and another spent cartridge case was recovered from the right barrel of the gun \\nafter completion of the investigation at the spot mukhtiar kaur  s dead body was sent for its post mortem examination \\nthe post mortem examination was also conducted by pw5 dr ishwar singh medical officer civil hospital along with dr harwinder kaur pw17 and it was found that mukhtiar kaur had two gunshot injuries on her dead body a wound of entry on the back of right side of chest 2 cm x 1 cm with margining and blackening and a corresponding exit wound of 5 cm x 3 5 cm to the front of the right side of the chest \\ndr harwinder kaur aforesaid also took swabs from the vagina of the deceased and as per the chemical examiner  s report dated 2 1 2003 semen was found on the swab taken from the vagina and from the underwear that mukhtiar kaur had been wearing at the time of her death \\nthe weapon and the recovered cartridge cases had also been sent to the forensic science laboratory which in its report dated 4 8 2004 opined that the crime cartridge case ci could have been fired by the right barrel of the weapon whereas the crime cartridge case c2 had been fired from the right barrel \\non the completion of the investigation a charge sheet under sections 302 376 and 309 of the ipc was filed against the accused and as he pleaded not guilty he was brought to trial \\nduring the trial jora singh pw1 satnam singh pw2 gurdeep singh pw3 and kulwant singh pw4 resiled from their statements given to the police and were declared hostile \\nbalwinder singh pw9 however supported the prosecution case deposing that the land had in fact been got transferred from gurmail kaur mother of mukhtiar kaur to ujjagar singh by fraud and mukhtiar kaur was therefore entitled to its return \\nhe also deposed that mukhtiar kaur had told him some time earlier that the accused had been beating her and had also committed sexual intercourse with her and that at about 11 p m on 10 11 2002 karam singh pw10 had informed him as to what had transpired on which he along with his father hamir singh pw12 and several others had rushed to bangawali \\npw10 karam singh aforesaid confirmed the story given by balwinder singh \\nthe prosecution also relied on the statements of dr vijay kumar pw6 of the civil hospial dhuri who testified that the appellant had been brought to the hospital at about 2 45 p m on 10 11 2002 with a serious gun shot injury dr ripan miglani pw15 of the dayanand medical college hospital ludhiana who deposed that he had been admitted to the department of neuro surgery with a serious gun shot injury and dr sanjay uppal pw16 a plastic surgeon who disclosed that the appellant had been under his treatment for almost 5 weeks and the burnt area around the firearm injury had been removed by him \\nthe prosecution also placed reliance on the statement of asi jasbir singh pw11 who had accompanied inspector harjinder pal singh pw14 to the place of incident and supported the recoveries made from the spot \\nthe prosecution case was then put to the accused and his statement recorded section \\n313 of the cr \\np c in reply to question 33 he stated as under i am innocent \\ni have been implicated falsely in this case \\ni was treating mukhtiar kaur as my daughter and loved her as my daughter \\nfalse allegations have been levelled against me \\ni never harassed mukhtiar kaur nor ever got her land mutated from her mother by fraud \\ni have not killed mukhtiar kaur \\nmother of mukhtiar kaur got the land mutated by her own free will and mukhtiar kaur had no dispute about it \\nbalwinder singh her husband was addicted to vices and used to beat her due to which she used to remain under depression and sick generally and used to come to me as my daughter \\nmy house kothi is situated on the outer skirts of village bangawali and door planks had not been fixed so far to rooms \\nsome body suddenly came and fired at me \\ni fell down on the ground and became unconscious \\ntherefore i could not see what had happened to mukhtiar kaur as she was in other room \\nlater on i came to know that some body had fired at her and she died \\ni regained consciousness in hospital \\nthe story of rape by me with her has been fabricated by her husband as he is inimical towards me \\neven i do not know who took me to hospital \\ni have been implicated in this case falsely \\nthe trial court and the high court relying on the circumstances available on the evidence convicted and sentenced the appellant as already mentioned above \\nmr goburdhan the learned counsel for the accused has raised several arguments in the course of hearing \\nhe has pointed out that there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that mukhtiar kaur had been subjected to rape and in this view of the matter the very basis for the imposition of the death penalty was not made out \\nhe has also pointed out that there were no eye witnesses to the incident and the 4 witnesses i e jora singh and others who had reached the place of incident and carried the injured appellant to the hospital had also resiled and as the prosecution story now rested on circumstantial evidence alone it was imperative for the investigating officer to have taken the finger prints from the weapon and that in any case the recovery of the spent cartridges and the gun were clearly suspicious as the weapon had been sent to the laboratory after an inordinate delay \\nit has also been submitted that in a case of attempted suicide a firearm must of necessity be used from a very close range and the absence of any blackening charring or burning around the wound on ujjagar singh clearly ruled out the possibility of such an attempt \\nit has finally been submitted that the land had been transferred in the name of ujjagar singh  s sons in the year 1994 by gurmail kaur mother of mukhtiar kaur by a collusive decree and there was no evidence to show that mukhtiar kaur had ever displayed any unhappiness or made any complaint to any person or any authority with regard to the decree and as such the very basis of the prosecution story did not exist \\nthe learned state counsel has however supported the judgment of the courts below \\nhe has further emphasized that the prosecution  s case stood proved from various factors including the medical evidence the reports of the forensic science laboratory the chemical examiner from the post mortem reports and the recovery of the gun and cartridges \\nwe have heard the learned counsel for the parties and gone through the record \\nwe first take up for consideration the question of the conviction section 376 of the ipc \\nwe find from the medical evidence and from the chemical examiner  s reports that the vaginal swab and clothes taken from the dead body did indicate the presence of semen \\nthere is however absolutely no evidence to suggest even assuming that the intercourse had been committed by the appellant that he had done so without mukhtiar kaur  s consent or against her will \\nsome suspicions of rape could perhaps have been raised had some tell tale injuries been detected on mukhtiar kaur  s person but we find that the two injuries other than the gun shot wounds i e injury no 3 being on the left pinna and \\nno 4 an abrasion near the right eye do not indicate any attempt to rape or the commission of rape \\nit is also significant that the investigators had made no attempt whatsoever to have the appellant medically examined to ascertain his capacity to perform sexual intercourse \\nthe learned state counsel relying on the statement of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh has however submitted that the examination had not been possible as the appellant had received a very serious gun shot injury and was hanging between life and death \\nwe agree with the submission of the learned counsel that an examination could not have been carried out immediately \\nbut we see no justification in the omission of the prosecution to have him examined after he had recovered his health and been discharged from hospital \\nwe are further of the opinion that even assuming for a moment that sexual intercourse between the two had indeed taken place it can not be said from the evidence before us that it was without the consent or against the wishes of mukhtiar kaur \\nwe therefore find that ujjagar singh  s conviction section 376 of the ipc can not be sustained \\nmr goburdhan has placed great emphasis on the fact that as the four witnesses who had reached the place of incident i e jora singh satnam singh gurdeep singh and kulwant singh had resiled from their statements and had disowned their initial stories the prosecution had of necessity to rely on circumstantial evidence and if the chain of circumstances remained incomplete or even if one link in the chain was broken the prosecution must fail \\nhe has also relied on the judgment of balu sonba shinde v state of maharashtra 2002 7 scc 543 2002 indlaw sc 1923 to contend that it was open to the accused to take advantage insofar as possible from the statement of a witness though declared hostile and the four witnesses having disowned the prosecution story and having given a different version the appellant was entitled to derive such benefit as possible in this situation \\nthe learned state counsel has however emphasized that both the trial court and the high court had for good reasons opined that the circumstances made out a case for conviction and the accused having given a counter version some obligation lay on him as well to explain the circumstances against him inasmuch that admittedly he and the victim were alone in the house at the time of the incident \\nreliance for this argument has been placed on the decision of raj kumar prasad tamarkar v state of bihar anr 20071 \\nscale 19 2007 indlaw sc 5 \\nwe have considered their arguments very carefully \\nin mahmood v state of u p 1976 1 scc 542 1975 indlaw sc 643 it has been observed that in a case dependent wholly on circumstantial evidence the court must be satisfied athat the circumstances from which the inference of guilt is to be drawn have been fully established by unimpeachable evidence beyond a shadow of doubt bthat the circumstances are of a determinative tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused and cthat the circumstances taken collectively are incapable of explanation on any reasonable hypothesis save that of the guilt sought to be proved against him \\nin this case this court held that the omission of the prosecution inter alia to have the finger prints found on the alleged murder weapon was fatal to the prosecution story \\nin 1984 4 scc 116 sharad birdhichand sarda v state of maharashtra 1984 indlaw sc 432 this court discussed the ratio of the judgments in hanumant v state of m p air 1952 sc 343 1952 indlaw sc 89 tufail alias simmi v state of u p 1969 3 scc 198 1969 indlaw sc 573 and ramgopal v state of maharashtra 1972 4 scc 625 1971 indlaw sc 555 and shivaji sahabrao bobade v state of maharashtra 1973 2 scc 793 1973 indlaw sc 181 and observed thus a close analysis of this decision would show that the following conditions must be fulfilled before a case against an accused can be said to be fully established 1the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established \\nit may be noted here that this court indicated that the circumstances concerned must or should and not may be established \\nthere is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between may be proved and must be or should be proved as was held by this court in shivaji sahabrao bobade v state of maharashtra 1973 indlaw sc 181 where the following observations were made \\ncertainly it is a primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and the mental distance between may be is long and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions \\n2the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused that is to say they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty 3the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency 4they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved and 5there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused \\nmr goburdhan has also cited mahmood v state of u p 1976 1 scc 542 1975 indlaw sc 643 shankarlal gyarasilal dixit v state of maharashtra 1981 2 scc 35 1980 indlaw sc 47 sharad birdhichand sarda v state of maharashtra 1984 4 scc 116 1984 indlaw sc 432 omwati smt and

sc 144 in support of his plea relating to the evaluation of circumstantial evidence \\nthese judgments have broadly followed the principles laid down in the judgments referred to above and need not therefore be dealt with us in extenso \\nit must nonetheless be emphasized that whether a chain is complete or not would depend on the facts of each case emanating from the evidence and no universal yardstick should ever be attempted \\nit is in this background that we must examine the circumstances in the present case \\na few facts stand out from the prosecution story \\nfirst the place of incident being adjoining rooms in the residential house of the appellant and the fact that the alleged murder weapon is his licensed dbbl gun is proved on record \\nthe evidence also reveals that the appellant was living in the premises along with his wife mother and son and two daughters who were studying outside the village were frequent visitors but it is the admitted position that nobody but the appellant and the deceased were present at the time of incident \\nit is also clear from the evidence that the two spent cartridge cases recovered one from near mukhtiar kaur  s dead body and the second from the right barrel of the gun lying near the appellant had been sent to the forensic science laboratory which opined that one of the cartridges had been fired from the gun and the other could have been fired therefrom \\nmr goburdhan has however laid great emphasis on the fact that no reference to the gun or cartridges had been made in the inquest report and that in any case the weapon and the spent cartridges had been sent to the laboratory belatedly \\nwe are of the opinion however that no adverse inference can be drawn from either of these circumstances \\nthe aforesaid articles had been carried to the laboratory by constable gopal singh who in his affidavit dated 17th march 2003 deposed that he had first taken the articles to the laboratory on 9th december 2002 but they had been returned by the director on the ground that the seals affixed thereon were not of the requisite number and that after removing the objections raised by the director the articles aforesaid had been returned to the laboratory on 18th december 2002 \\ngopal singh was cross examined by the prosecution \\nand but for some inconsequential questions put to him with regard to the seals not even a suggestion was made that the aforesaid articles had in any way been tampered with \\nit is true as contended that in column 22 of the inquest report which refers to the articles found near the dead body there is no reference to the spent cartridges or the murder weapon but we find from a perusal of the site plan exh \\npjj prepared by the investigating officer inspector harjinder pal singh pw14 on 10th november 2002 that the weapon is shown lying close to the place where the appellant had been found unconscious and a spent cartridge recovered from near the dead body of mukhtiar kaur \\nit has also been submitted by mr goburdhan that there appeared to be no motive for the incident as the story about mukhtiar kaur  s unhappiness about the transfer of land to the sons of ujjagar singh sought to be proved by pw9 balwinder singh and pw10 karam singh had been disbelieved by the high court with the observation that the statements of these two witnesses could not be relied upon \\nit is true that in a case relating to circumstantial evidence motive does assume great importance but to say that the absence of motive would dislodge the entire prosecution story is perhaps giving this one factor an importance which is not due and to use the clichi \\nthe motive is in the mind of the accused and can seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy \\nthere is however a hint in the testimony of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh that his enquiries had revealed that the accused was having illicit relations with mukhtiar kaur and we can assume that some thing untoward had happened which could have triggered the volatile and hostile incident \\nthere could perhaps be some truth in this suggestion as it is significant that though the appellant had an extended family living with him i e mother wife son living in the village and two young daughters who were studying outside and residing in a hostel but were frequent visitors home yet none of them has come forth to depose in his favour \\nto our mind therefore this is yet another circumstance inculpating the accused \\nmr goburdhan has also laid much stress on the apparent discordance between the prosecution story and the medical evidence and has argued that had the accused attempted to commit suicide the gun shot must of necessity had to be fired from a very close range on which the wound would have marks of burning or charring and that in any event a full blooded shot from a very close range would have torn his face apart \\nhe has in this connection referred us to the statement of dr ripan miglani pw15 and the wound found on the appellant at the time of his medical examination in the department of surgery of the dayanand medical college hospital ludhiana which was about 15 x 8 cm curvilinear wound present on the left half of face extending upto bone \\nno blackening or foreign body was visible \\nunderlying muscles were exposed and contamination was present \\nhe has thus urged that the absence of any blackening underlined the argument that the shot had been fired from some distance and as such an attempt at suicide was clearly to be ruled out \\nhe has also drawn our attention to the cross examination of the doctor wherein he reiterated that there was no visible blackening and that it was not possible for him to say whether the injury was suicidal or otherwise \\nthe learned state counsel has however relied on the statement of pw16 dr sanjay uppal who was apparently the first doctor to have examined the appellant wherein he clearly testified that the blackened portion around the firearm injury had been removed by him \\nwe are therefore of the opinion that this statement falsifies mr goburdhan  s argument on this aspect \\nit is also significant that the shot had apparently travelled upwards skirting the mandible through the flesh of the cheek in an upward direction with minimal damage to the bone structure and it is indeed providential that the appellant got away with only an injury albeit a very serious one \\nthe fact that the shot was fired from below going upwards is also supported by the site plan exh \\npjj wherein marks of a shot hitting the roof were seen at point e whereas the appellant was found lying at point d in the same room \\nit is therefore apparent that the weapon had indeed been fired by the appellant from a close range and that the blackened portion around the wound had been removed by dr sanjay uppal \\nthe learned state counsel has emphasized that in the light of the admitted position that the accused and the deceased were the only ones present at the time of incident and that the accused had projected a counter story some credible explanation was also expected from him \\nreference has been made to raj kumar prasad tamarkar  s case2007 indlaw sc 5 supra wherein in circumstances surprisingly akin to the present matter this court had the following observations to make the conspectus of the events which had been noticed by the learned sessions judge as also by the high court categorically go to show that at the time when the occurrence took place the deceased and the respondent only were in the bedroom and the terrace connecting the same \\nthere was no other person \\nthe cause of death of the deceased usha devi i e by a gun shot injury is not disputed \\nthe fact that the terrace and the bedroom are adjoining each other is not in dispute \\nthe autopsy report shows that a blackening and charring existed so far as injury no i is concerned \\nthe blackening and charring keeping in view the nature of the firearm which is said to have been used clearly go to show that a shot was fired from a short distance \\nblackening or charring is possible when a shot is fired from a distance of about 2 feet to 3 feet \\nit therefore can not be a case where the death might have been caused by somebody by firing a shot at the deceased from a distance of more than 6 feet \\nthe place of injury is also important \\nthe lacerated wound was found over grabella middle of forehead \\nit goes a long way to show that the same must have been done by a person who wanted to kill the deceased from a short distance \\nthere was thus a remote possibility of causation of such type of injury by any other person who was not in the terrace \\nonce the prosecution has been able to show that at the relevant time the room and terrace were in exclusive occupation of the couple the burden of proof lay upon the respondent to show under what circumstances death was caused to his wife \\nthe onus was on him \\nhe failed to discharge the same \\nwe have considered the submission of the state counsel very carefully \\nit is true that it is generally for the prosecution to prove its case beyond doubt but in circumstances such as the present one some explanation is also due from an accused in order to absolve himself from suspicion of the crime \\nin his statement section p c his positive stand was that he alone had been in the house with mukhtiar kaur when she had been killed and indeed as per exhibit p jj mukhtiar kaur  s body had been found only one karam 5 feet away from the place where the appellant lay injured \\nit must be emphasized that but for this self serving statement made by the appellant there is nothing on record to support his positive stance \\neven otherwise we are of the opinion that had the shot been fired by some intruder the direction would have been more or less horizontal and parallel to the ground and not from down upwards with the pellets hitting the jaw skirting the cheek and hitting the roof at point \\ne in modi  s medical jurisprudence and toxicology 23rd edition at page 765 while dealing with identification of homicidal and suicidal injuries it has been observed that a suicidal firearm wound is usually a contact wound situated on the side of the temple depending on which hand was used to shoot himself in the centre of the forehead the roof of the mouth in the chest or epigastrium in front or the left side and some times under the chin \\nthe firearm is usually fired at close range \\na small weapon like a revolver or a pistol is held in the hand while a rifle or a shot gun is supported on the ground or against the wall \\nsometimes the firing is done by pulling a string tied to the trigger by the big toe \\nthe skin around the entry wound shows characteristic blackening scorching and tattooing \\nin such cases the hand used to steady the weapon at the muzzle may be blackened and scorched and may also be stained with squirting of the blood from the injured arteries \\nin homicidal and accidental shooting the wound may be on any part of the body and the path of the bullet may be in any direction \\nhomicidal shooting by dacoits is not uncommon in india and they are known to make their own firearms \\nimmediate death following a firearm wound is uncommon and even when vital organs are injured a person may be capable of doing extraordinary things \\nsometimes firearm wounds may look like knife slashes or a bullet hole may resemble a penetrating stab wound if the bullet strikes the head of shoulder at an angle or when an unstable bullet registers a broadside hit \\na fateh describes a rare homicidal gun shot wound of the mouth where the entry wound was in the tongue and the direction was horizontally backward while in suicidal wounds the direction is upwards entrance would be in the palate or posterior pharynx \\ndr b r sharma in his book forensic science in criminal investigation and trials fourth edition at page 1160 too has delineated the circumstances that could indicate suicide and while referring to the site of the injury has observed certain sites are predominantly used by suicides for self inflicted injuries \\nfor example with firearm temple forehead mouth and chest are the favourite sites \\nwith knife throat and wrist are the favourite sites \\nhesitation injuries are also observed in some suicide cases \\nit is therefore clear to us that the story of unknown assailants entering the house and causing mukhtiar kaur  s murder etcetera has to be ruled out and that the prosecution story that it was the appellant who had first shot mukhtiar kaur and then attempted to commit suicide stands proved \\nwe also find that no part of the evidence of the hostile witnesses comes to the aid of the appellant \\nthe question now arises as to the sentence that should be imposed on the appellant \\nit would be seen that both the sessions court and the high court were appalled by the allegations and findings of incestuous rape and murder \\nwe are however of the opinion as already noted above that a case of rape has not been made out \\nin this background the death sentence is not called for

got the trade mark  field marshal  registered under clause  7  inter alia for flour mills centrifugal pumps couplings for machines pulleys included in class 7 and valves  parts of machines   the said registration was renewed for the periods 13 5 1972 and 12 5 1979  13 5 1979 and 12 7 1986 and 13 7 1986 and 12 7 1993  appellant is said to have commenced its business of manufacturing and selling centrifugal pumps also under the mark  field marshall  allegedly on the premise that the first respondent is the proprietor of the said mark by reason of long user and thus acquired a reputation in that behalf a legal notice was issued upon it questioning its right to use the said mark in respect of centrifugal pumps by the appellant laying a claim that it had been using the said mark since 1963  respondent no 1 thereafter filed a suit in the delhi high court for grant of a decree of permanent injunction being suit no 2408 of 1985 alleging infringement of the said mark and or claiming right of passing off in respect thereof  an ex parte order of injunction was passed on 19 12 1985 against the defendant  meanwhile a temporary ex parte injunction is issued against the defendants restraining them from manufacturing or selling either themselves or through any dealer or representative diesel oil engines or parts thereof with the trade mark  field marshal  and or any other trade mark identical therewith and all goods falling in cl 7 of the trade and merchandise mark rules  the second rectification application filed by the first respondent however was transferred to the intellectual property appellate board  the said application was dismissed  a writ petition was filed there against by the first respondent  a learned single judge of the delhi high court however refused to stay the operation of the order of the board dated 27 10 2004 an appeal was preferred there against  the division bench of the high court thereafter while disposing of both the writ petition and the letters patent appeal allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of the board and directed it to adjudicate the dispute on merits  the said order of the division bench is under challenge in this appeal   argument appellant s counsel appeared on that date and inter alia contended that presently it was the registered owner of the trade mark which was sought to be cancelled  in view of that statement a submission was made on behalf of the first respondent that it may be permitted to withdraw the petition with liberty to file a fresh petition on the same cause of action   issue whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case the application under s 46 1  b  was maintainable  whether  to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps  goods  so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned   analysis the core question which arises for our consideration is as to whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case the application under s 46 1  b  was maintainable  indisputably the scope of the provisions for removal from register in terms of s 46 and 56 of the act stand on different footings  whereas s 46 had a limited application s 56 of the act is wider in nature  concededly cl  a  of sub s  1  of s 46 is not attracted in the case  the prayer in the application was to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps  goods  so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned  it is in the aforementioned situation it is advisable to determine the meaning of the words  for the time being  occurring in s 46 1  b  of the act  two interpretations thereto which are possible are   1  the said words would denote non use of the trade mark in relation to the goods by the appellant for a period of five years or longer  and  2  the mark had not been used for a period of five years or longer either by the present proprietor thereof or his predecessor  the words  for the time being  would mean differently in different situations  it may mean  the moment or existing position  as was held by this court in the case of jivendra nath kaul v  collector district magistrate and anr   1992  3 scc 576 1992 indlaw sc 1107  or in the context of cl  22  of art 366 of the constitution as has been held in h h maharajadhiraja  madhav rao jivaji rao scindia bahadur of gwalior h h maharajadhiraja  maharana shri bhagwat singhji bahadur of udaipur v  union of india and anr  air 1971  sc 530 1970 indlaw sc 300 para 88  to mean   by the use of the expression  for the time being  in cl  22  of art 366  the president is not invested with authority to accord a temporary recognition to a ruler nor with authority to recognize or not to recognize a ruler arbitrarily   the expression  for them time being  predicts that there shall be a ruler of the indian state that if the first recognized ruler dies or ceases to be a ruler a successor shall be appointed and that there shall not be more rulers than one at a given time  the person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods as that of the registered owner  it confers an exclusive right of use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in which the trade mark is registered  whether s 46 1  b  read with s 48 of the act would bring within its purview not only a registered proprietor but also the proprietor who had otherwise acquired a right would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case  the court while construing a statute takes into consideration the parliamentary intent in amending the provisions thereof  it seeks to enhance the period of moratorium of use of the registered trade mark from one month to three months so as to prevent speculative assignment  thus a case of speculative assignment is specifically required to be made out  such an application may be maintainable in terms of s 56 of the act but strictly not in terms of s 46 1  b  thereof and that too in the absence of the original registered proprietor  attention has again been drawn to a passage from  law of trade marks    geographical indications  by shri k c kailasam wherein the judgment of the tribunal has been criticized in the following terms    from the above legislative intent it would seem that the period of non use of the trade mark is to be reckoned continuously from the date of its registration  in the case of american home products corporation v  mac laboratories pvt ltd  rendered under the 1958 act it was held by the supreme court that  the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the register has only to prove  such continuous non user   it would appear that neither the u k act nor the indian act at any time envisaged that the commencement of 5 year period of non use is to be delinked from the date of registration of the mark so as to give a fresh lease of life to the registration every time there is change in the ownership of the mark  if that be so any registered proprietor could easily defeat an application for rectification by assigning the mark to some other person to have a fresh period of 5 years from the date of assignment and thus effectively frustrate the very object of the provision in s 47 1  a  and  b   further it is to be noted that an assignment is subject to  the provisions of the act and any rights vested in any other person   see  s 37  the assignor cannot obviously transfer more rights than he himself has to the assignee under the act  an assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses   statute interpretation of the provisions of s 46 1  b   and section 48 of the trade and merchandise marks act 1958  \",\n          \"facts tata consultant engineers was a partnership firm but subsequently the partnership was dissolved and in 1974 the undertaking became one of the divisions of tata sons limited  it functions as a consulting organisation and a service industry and does not manufacture any product or carry on trade its work force consists of engineers and supervisors and different categories of workmen  the tata consultant employees union served a charter of demands in july 1974 on the appellant and as their demands were not accepted and conciliation proceedings proved fruitless the state government made a reference of the dispute under s 10 1  d  industrial tribunal maharashtra for adjudication  the union filed a statement before the tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments  it was urged that the efficiency bar as a feature of the wage scales should be removed  the dearness allowance it was claimed should be granted on a slab system  the claim of the union was resisted by the appellant who maintained that the existing wage scales were fair and reasonable on a region cum industry basis and that it would not be possible for the appellant to bear the additional financial burden if the demands of the union were accepted  the appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised  there was no separate dearness allowance until january 1977 when it was introduced for the first time  house rent allowance was also paid  dearness allowance became payable at 10  of the basic wage subject to a minimum of rs 50  and house rent allowance at 30  of the basic salary  the tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years there was definite need for revising the wage scales  it also laid down the principle enabling the actual fitment of the workmen in their respective wage scales as on that date and also provided for the number of increments to which they would be entitled having regard to the period of completed service  two days after the award was made an application was made by the union stating   in the said award your honour has observed at the end of para 22 in view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay i do not propose to revise the existing scheme of dearness allowance   the workmen have filed an appeal by special leave  in which they have challenged the rejection by the tribunal of their claim in respect of dearness allowance which they contend should be pegged to the cost of living index and should not be a fixed amount   argument considering the appeal of tata consulting engineers first the contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant the tribunal erred in making the wage scales retrospective and in any event in ranging the retrospectivity back to 1st january 1976  the learned counsel for the appellant had covered a wide field but in the end he states that the appellant is aggrieved by two matters only  one is the retrospectivity attached to the revised wage scales and the other is the flat increase given to each employee of rs 150  in the category of draughtsmen and rs 100  in other categories resulting from the order dated 22nd december 1978  it is urged that the amendment results in the inclusion of a flat increase of rs 150  to each workman in the case of draughtsman and rs 100  to each workman in the case of other categories a result wholly unwarranted it is said by the intent of the original award and therefore falling beyond the jurisdiction of the tribunal  the only contention of the workmen is that the tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index   issue the primary and basic question considered by the industrial tribunal in making the award dated december 20 1978 was the question of revision of the wage scales  implicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage scales and flat or ad hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary   analysis it must be remembered that although the wage scales were introduced as long ago as 1973 they were maintained at that level except for a slight revision some time thereafter  no dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time  the cost of living had gone on increasing from 1972 onwards and as the tribunal has found the dearness allowance and house rent allowance made no appreciable impact in neutralising the increasing cost  during all these years the appellant had continued to enjoy increasing profits  nonetheless the emoluments received by the workmen did not receive the impress of the appellant s growing prosperity  the charter of demands was presented by the union in july 1974 and when conciliation proceedings failed the state government made the reference to the industrial tribunal in 1975  they are considerations which cannot be ignored  accordingly the contention raised on behalf of the appellant against retrospectivity of the wage scales must be rejected  the financial capacity of the appellant and the related study of its annual profits from 1968 to 1977 were examined from that view point  the sufficiency of the existing pay scales was considered in detail and regard was had to their original structure and the accretions made subsequently by way of dearness allowance and house rent allowance  for the purpose of restructuring the pay scales the tribunal ruled on the paying capacity of the appellant both with reference to the profits of the preceding year as well as the prospects of the future  the financial capacity as the tribunal observed constituted one of  the principles which are required to be followed in the fixation of the wage structure   no ad hoc increase to the pay of each individual workman was intended  the jurisdiction given to the tribunal by rule 31 is closely circumscribed  it is only a clerical mistake or error which can be corrected and the clerical mistake or error must arise from an accidental slip or omission in the award  an accidental slip or omission implies that something was intended and contrary to that intention what should not have been included has been included or what should have been included has been omitted  it must be a mistake or error amenable to clerical correction only  it must not be a mistake or error which calls for rectification by modification of the conscious adjudication on the issues involved  the omission of the words to each employee first after the figure rs 150  and again after the figure rs 100  was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the tribunal was entitled to correct  it will be noted that the pay scales of different categories were being restructured and the flat increase envisaged there related to an increase in the general pay scales of different categories  individual workmen were not present to the mind of the tribunal  that the increase was pertinent to the general pay scales in the revised wage structure is patently clear from a comparison of the existing pay scales and the revised pay scales  the comparative table of existing pay scales and the revised pay scales has been reproduced earlier  the revised pay scales of all categories except the category of draughtsmen shows an increase of rs 100  in the initial pay fixed in each scale the increase in the case of the category of draughtsmen being rs 150   the amendment made by the tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase this time to each individual workmen  if as the tribunal has stated in the amendment order the increase in paragraph 23 was intended to apply to each individual workmen there is nothing in the body of the award to form the foundation on which the actual figures in the restructured pay scales can be made to rest  there will be no explanation why the initial start of the revised pay scales has been increased by rs 150  in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100  in the case of other categories  considering the fitment of the workman in the revised scales it was stated in the award that a workman found drawing a salary less than the beginning of the grade would be stepped up to the beginning of the grade and if his pay fell between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay was to be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale  reliance was placed on the hindustan times ltd  new delhi v their workmen  1964  1 scr 234 1962 indlaw sc 436 247 where it was observed by this court that dearness allowance should not remain fixed at any figure but should be on a sliding scale in order to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living  now it is not a universal rule that the dearness allowance should in all cases be correlated with the cost of living index  it was open to the tribunal to adopt the position which it did  if the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered  the award is a composite document in which the several elements of increased wage scales larger increments longer span of 20 years for earning increments dearness allowance at 10  of the basic wage besides several other benefits have been integrated into a balanced arrangement in keeping with what the tribunal has found to be the financial capacity of the appellant  it is not possible to maintain one part of the award and supersede another  conspicuous by its absence is any reference to a flat increase in the pay of an individual workmen  we are not impressed with the submission that the corrigendum was in effect a fresh award  we therefore see no ground for quashing the of the tribunal  dearness allowance linked to cost of living index is ordinarily the best and the most scientific method of computing dearness allowance it cannot always be said that an illegality warranting interference under article 136 is committed if some other method is adopted  the tribunal has given satisfactory reason for adopting a different mode and we are not disposed to interfere with the award of the tribunal   statute in making the application of 22nd december 1978 the union invoked the jurisdiction of the tribunal under rule 31 of the industrial disputes  bombay  rules 1957  rule 31 provides  the labour court tribunal or arbitrator may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any award it or he issues  the application before the tribunal was filed under rule 31 of the bombay industrial disputes rules 1957 which is as follows   a board court labour court tribunal or arbitrator may at any time suo moto or on an application made by any of the parties concerned may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any proceedings report award or as the case may be    \",\n          \"facts ujjagar singh  the appellant herein  was tried and convicted by the additional sessions judge  sangrur for the murder of his niece mukhtiar kaur and was awarded the death penalty  in addition  he was convicted for an offence punishable u s  376 of the ipc and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to a fine of rs 5  000   and in default of payment to undergo further r i  for one year and u s  309 of the ipc to a sentence of simple imprisonment for one year  the aforesaid convictions and sentences have been maintained by the high court and the matter is before us in these proceedings by way of special leave  at about 2 00 p m  on 10th november 2002 a boy whose identity is not forthcoming  informed satnam singh pw2 that an incident of firing had taken place in the house of ujjagar singh   satnam singh conveyed this information to sarpanch jora singh pw1 who was attending a marriage at that time  jora singh accompanied by gurdeep singh pw3 thereupon rushed to ujjagar singh s house and found mukhtiar kaur lying dead with a gun shot injury and the appellant also with a gun shot injury lying unconscious on the ground in the adjoining room  it appears that mukhtiar kaur s relations with her in laws had got strained and she had left her matrimonial home and come to live with ujjagar singh  her uncle  7 or 8 months earlier and the suggestion was that mukhtiar kaur had been killed by the appellant with his licensed gun and he had thereafter attempted to commit suicide   argument the learned counsel for the accused has raised several arguments in the course of hearing  he has pointed out that there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that mukhtiar kaur had been subjected to rape and in this view of the matter the very basis for the imposition of the death penalty was not made out  he has also pointed out that there were no eye witnesses to the incident and the 4 witnesses i e  jora singh and others who had reached the place of incident and carried the injured appellant to the hospital had also resiled and as the prosecution story now rested on circumstantial evidence alone  it was imperative for the investigating officer to have taken the finger prints from the weapon and that in any case the recovery of the spent cartridges and the gun were clearly suspicious as the weapon had been sent to the laboratory after an inordinate delay  it has also been submitted that in a case of attempted suicide a firearm must of necessity be used from a very close range and the absence of any blackening  charring or burning around the wound on ujjagar singh clearly ruled out the possibility of such an attempt  it has finally been submitted that the land had been transferred in the name of ujjagar singh s sons in the year 1994 by gurmail kaur  mother of mukhtiar kaur by a collusive decree and there was no evidence to show that mukhtiar kaur had ever displayed any unhappiness or made any complaint to any person or any authority with regard to the decree and as such  the very basis of the prosecution story did not exist  he had laid great emphasis on the fact that no reference to the gun or cartridges had been made in the inquest report and that in any case the weapon and the spent cartridges had been sent to the laboratory belatedly   issue convictions and sentences by the high court should be maintained or not   analysis from the medical evidence and from the chemical examiner s reports that the vaginal swab and clothes taken from the dead body did indicate the presence of semen  there is however absolutely no evidence to suggest  even assuming that the intercourse had been committed by the appellant  that he had done so without mukhtiar kaur s consent or against her will  it is also significant that the investigators had made no attempt whatsoever to have the appellant medically examined to ascertain his capacity to perform sexual intercourse  it must nonetheless be emphasized that whether a chain is complete or not would depend on the facts of each case emanating from the evidence and no universal yardstick should ever be attempted  it is in this background that we must examine the circumstances in the present case  a few facts stand out from the prosecution story  first  the place of incident being adjoining rooms in the residential house of the appellant and the fact that the alleged murder weapon is his licensed dbbl gun is proved on record  the evidence also reveals that the appellant was living in the premises along with his wife  mother and son  and two daughters  who were studying outside the village  were frequent visitors  but it is the admitted position that nobody but the appellant and the deceased were present at the time of incident  it is also clear from the evidence that the two spent cartridge cases recovered  one from near mukhtiar kaur s dead body  and the second from the right barrel of the gun lying near the appellant had been sent to the forensic science laboratory which opined that one of the cartridges had been fired from the gun and the other could have been fired therefrom  it is true that in a case relating to circumstantial evidence motive does assume great importance but to say that the absence of motive would dislodge the entire prosecution story is perhaps giving this one factor an importance which is not due and  to use the clichi  the motive is in the mind of the accused and can seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy  there is however a hint in the testimony of pw14 inspector harjinder pal singh that his enquiries had revealed that the accused was having illicit relations with mukhtiar kaur and we can assume that some thing untoward had happened which could have triggered the volatile and hostile incident  there could perhaps be some truth in this suggestion  as it is significant that though the appellant had an extended family living with him i e  mother  wife  son living  in the village  and two young daughters who were studying outside and residing in a hostel  but were frequent visitors home  yet none of them has come forth to depose in his favour  therefore  this is yet another circumstance inculpating the accused  it is also significant that the shot had apparently travelled upwards skirting the mandible  through the flesh of the cheek in an upward direction with minimal damage to the bone structure and it is indeed providential that the appellant got away with only an injury  albeit a very serious one  the fact that the shot was fired from below going upwards is also supported by the site plan exh  pjj wherein marks of a shot hitting the roof were seen at point e whereas the appellant was found lying at point d in the same room  it is therefore apparent that the weapon had indeed been fired by the appellant from a close range and that the blackened portion around the wound had been removed by dr  sanjay uppal  it is true that it is generally for the prosecution to prove its case beyond doubt but in circumstances such as the present one  some explanation is also due from an accused in order to absolve himself from suspicion of the crime  no part of the evidence of the hostile witnesses comes to the aid of the appellant  the question now arises as to the sentence that should be imposed on the appellant  it would be seen that both the sessions court and the high court were appalled by the allegations and findings of incestuous rape and murder  we are however of the opinion  as already noted above  that a case of rape has not been made out  in this background
